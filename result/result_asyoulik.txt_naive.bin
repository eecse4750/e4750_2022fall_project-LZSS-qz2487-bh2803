	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
	Never so much as in a thought unborn
	Did I offend your highness.

	They are as innocent as grace itself:

	Than that of painted pomp? Ar505649504854these woods

	Which, when it bit505648524856lows upon my body,
	Even till I shrink505653535154cold, I smile505652555155y
	'This is no flattery:505649505155are counsellors
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
	505649515255like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
	And this our life exempt f505657495754blic haunt
	Finds tongues in trees, book505648575054he running brooks,
	Sermons in ston505656495755good in every thing.
	I would not change it.

	Into so quiet and so s505654534854 style.

50574956524950Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,

	And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
	Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.

	Did he not moralize this spectacle?

51485054554949O, yes, into a thousand similes.
	First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
	'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more514851485655at 514851495654had too much:' then, be505754545354ere alone,
	Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
	''Tis right:' 505756555256; 'thus misery doth part
	The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
	Full 514851505355pasture, jumps 514855545154by him
	And never stays to greet him; 'Ay514849565056514852545157'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
	'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
	Thus most invectively he pierceth through514851515254body 514856545155country, city, court,
	Yea514948535254of this our life, swear514854525354at we

	To fright the animal514850495554to kill them up
	In their assign'd and native dwelling-place51494956524953And did you leave him in514949575454contemplation?

53495756554952	N535057515054 him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
	But were I not the better part made mercy,
	I should not seek an absent argument

	Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
	Seek him with candle; bring him dead or 535056574854
	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
	To seek a53514850524949our territory.
	Thy lands and all things that thou dost ca535051555355e
	Worth seizure do we seize into 535148485556s,
	Till thou canst quit thee by th535055505057s mouth

53515257554948	Truly, s535152574855, in respect of itself, it is a good

	but as535256495754535157535054 more plenty in it, it goes much
	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, 535252574856?

535253515654No535248535254but that I know the more one sickens the
	worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
	means and content is without three good friends;
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
	burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, 535251545457a

554856504957Yes, one, and554854575454is manner. He was to imagine me
	his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to

PHEBE	I would not be thy 55575151494949:
	I fly thee, for I 55574952494948injure thee.
	Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
	'Tis pretty, sure564849555554very probable,
	That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
	Who shut 555757555654coward gates on atomies,
	Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, 555753495754ers!
	Now I do frown 555756515354e with all my heart;
	And if 555754515356s can wound, now let them kill thee:
	Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
	Or if thou canst not, O555757514854shame55575351494948e,

	Nor, I am564853505555564853565357no force in eyes564853545455can do hurt.

SILVIUS	         555757505756 O dear Phebe,
	If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
	Then shall you know 564853505257s invisible564857525655love's keen arrows make.

PHEBE	But t564856485354at time
	Come not thou near me: and when 564850485657 comes,
	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
	As t56485152504951 I 564852525454not pity thee.

ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
	That you insult, exult, and all at once,
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
	As, by my faith, I see no more in you
	Than without candle may go dark to bed--
	Mus564854555554be therefore proud and pitiless?
	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
	56485553515048 than 564954495254 ordinary
	Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,

	No, 564948495555564857515554mistress, hop564951544954after it:
	'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your 564954565054of cream564951575756can entame my spirits to your worship.

	But, 56495651484948know yourself: down on your knees,
	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
	For I must tell you friendly 565051545354r ear,
	Sell whe565050535354can: you are not for all markets:
	Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
	Foul is most foul, being foul565054485054 a scoffer.
	So take her to thee, 565050535156: fare you well.

PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
	I had rather hear you564955515155than this man woo.

ROSALIND	He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
	fall56495650574952my anger. If it be so, as fast as
	she answers thee565055485154frowning looks, I'll sauce her
	with bitter words. Why look565054495454o upon me?

565050524854For no ill will I be5650505050545650504948495056505149534950do not f56505049544956e,

	Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
	'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
	Will you go, sister? S565055535255, ply her hard.
	Come,565050515655. 565050525656ess, look on him better565149535255be not proud: though all the world could see,

	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
	Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
	And mark what object did present49484857495355:
	Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
	And high top bal49484848535255dry antiquity,
	A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
	Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
	Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd49484949565555pening of his mouth; but suddenly,
	Seeing 49484949565255, it unlink'd4948485250564948And with indented glides did slip away
	Into a bush: under which bush's shade

	When that the 49484856565657man should stir; for 'tis
	The royal disposition of that beast
	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:

	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
	And nature, stronge49484949505755his just occasion,
	Made him give battle to the 49484957485556

	Committing me unto my 49485056505355's love;
	Who 49484957504955instantly unto his cave,
	There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
	The49485056485756 had torn some flesh away,
	Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
	Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
	And, after some small space49485055495256strong at heart,
	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
	T49485057485255this story, that you might excuse
	His broken promise, and to give this napkin
	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth

	EPILOGUE


ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
	but it is no more unhandsome tha4950514852574952ord
	the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
	no bush, 'tis 4950514948524948a good play needs no
	49505150535057 yet to 4950514957504948they do use good bushes,
	and g49505150505656s prove the better by the help of good4950515148534948s. What a case am I in then, that am
	neither 4950515251525549505153565356 nor cannot insinuate with
	you in the behalf of 4950515354544949! I am not
	furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
	become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
	with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
	you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
	please you: and I49505154555349534950515548525149women--as I perceive by your simpering,
	none of you hates them--that between you and the
	women the play may please. If I were a woman I
	would kiss as many 49505156564855as had beards that pleased
	me, complexion49505156525555liked me and breath49505156575755I
	defied not: and, I am sure, 49505248485156as have good
	49505248505255or good faces or sweet b49505248514855will, for my
	kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
