49485748505053The Pool of Tears


  `Curiouser and cur494857505154!' cried 494952515554(494953555656494952535255
494953575557, that for the momen494954514954494954554854forgot how to speak good
English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her
feet, they s494955565354494957535654almost out of sigh494950504856were getting so
far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes495048505055ockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't
be able!  I shall be a great deal too 494953515455 to trouble myself
about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
kind to them,' thought495053535454, `or perhaps they won't walk the
way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas.'

  And she went on planning to herself how she would 494957485555it.
`They must go by 495055534854rrier,' she 494957515755; `and how funny it'll
seem, sending presents to one's own feet!494957525554how odd the

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in
fact495053505454as now more than nin495057544854 high, and she at once took
up the 495148525655golden key and hurried 495057545156he garden door.

  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
side, to look through int49505157574951with one eye; but to get
495051554956was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
cry again.

  `You 495151505654to be ashamed of yourself,' said 495152485056a great
girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in
this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But 49515350554950all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall.

  After a time she heard a l495151545054pattering of feet in495155545055stance, 495152555356hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.

surprised to see495456505454she had put on one 495550555355Rabbit's 495456575655white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done
that?' she thought.  `49554953534948growing small again.'  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it495551485454found that,
as nearly 495552485355could guess, 495454525356now 495550544954two feet high,

cause of this was the fan495456575157holding495554504954she dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid sh495455564856away altogether.

`That WAS a narrow escape!' said 495552504855a good deal frightened at
the s495552564854change, but very glad to find 495549535756still in

trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in my own495649555654!  That WILL be a queer

wrapping itself up very carefully, 514953575554ing, `I really must be
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts
they all moved off, and 515053515454was soon left alone.

began to cry again, 515057535356felt very lonely and low-spirited.

ought 515549574954a book written about me, that 515550555454ought!  And when
I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a
sorrowful tone; `at leas515457494955's no room to 515457505455 any more
HERE.'

  `But then,51555255554948515552564856shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  That'll be a 515555565655, one way--515551495354515550535755n old woman-
-but then--a515554575354to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like
THAT!515550525754Oh, you foolish Alice!'515551574854nswered herself.  `How can you
learn515550515357in here?  Why, th515552565054hardly room for YOU515555524956
room at all for any 515551574954-books515551554954And so she went on, taking first one sid515649545554then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside515652524954stopped to listen.

  `Mary Ann!  515552505657' said the515553485454.  `Fetch me my gloves515652545654moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and
she trembled till she shook the house, 515557545454forgetting that she
was now 515654534954a thousand times as large as 51555652544948515650525254ha515650535454eason t515656485154fraid of it.

  Presently 51555755524950ame up to the doo515557575254 tri515650485754open it;
but, a515648574854door opened inwards515653504854Alice's elbow was pressed
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure515651495657515653485554it
say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.515657535054THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting t515653494855
fancied 5156555755494851565449574949just under 51565050514948, she suddenly
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not
get hold of anything, but 51574857514950515657555055shriek and a fall515750515354a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that 515748565754
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of the sor515748534854Nex515748525255an angry voice--51575149504948's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are
you?'  And then a515753505754515657485254ad never heard before, `Sure then
I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!51574952485451565450545048indeed!' said 51575455534949angrily.  `Here!
Come515753555454elp me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more51574948534951.)

  `Now tell me, Pat, what's 515749525654515751485054515752574954?'

  `Sure, it's an arm51565757524952  (He pronounced it `arrum.'515657505654An515656555455ou goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it

away515753485254There was a long silence524848575255this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then; such as515755535555, I don't like it, yer
515755545654515751524954ll, 515749565754!'  `Do as I tell you515753574954coward!' and at
las524850534854spread out her hand again515752534954made another snatch in
the air.  This time there were TWO little shriek515754485555more
so52484852485652484852564951  `What a number of 52485252514952s there
must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for
pulling 5248515155494852485055494948, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I
515757535254want to stay in here any longer524854485454She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  524848555356came a rumbling of 524848505555cartwheel524851494955the sound of a
good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
Bill524855485655515757495257--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
at this corner--No, tie 'em 524849505156 first--they 524855544854reach half

that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud
crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,

Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put ever524951505355upon524857524854
I wouldn't be in 524949575155place for a good deal:  this fire524853565654is
narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a 52495352495452495452554948drew her foot as far 52494855544954 as she could, and
waited till she heard 524856484956 animal (524855555557n't guess of what
sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in 52485752534950close
above her:  then, saying 52495052484948 `This is Bill,' she gave one
sharp kick, and wa524949485754o see what524951505354 happen next.

  The first thing 52495049514948was a general chorus of `There goes
Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`C525048505254im, you by the
hedge524949505556silence524950545654then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
What 524952554954524953485254you?  Tell us all 524954545355t!'

  Last came 524955575657feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's 524955505454
thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
better now--but I'm a deal too fluster524956575654tell you--all I know
is, some525051565354comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box525048535654up I goes
524953505655sky-rocket525051575554`So you did, 52495655544948!' said the others.

  `We must bur525052574954house down5249545251495052504957494952; and
Alice called out as loud a52505451494951`If you do.  I'll set
Dinah at you525055545554525052485654525052525354dead s525051535654 instantly525053555254524956535454525049565756to
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any
sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two524957504954
began moving 525053535354again5250485555495052505655495452505651514948 say, `A
barrowful will do, to begin with.'

  `A b525048505257of WHAT?' th52505548544949; but she had not long to
doubt, for the next moment a shower of 525057485255pebbles came
rattling in 525052525154 window525149545454some of them hit her in the face.
`I'll put a stop to this,' she 525056525654o 525054534957and shouted out,
`You'd 525149494957t do tha525054485755!' which produced another dead
s525056545354.

  525057565254noticed with525053494954surprise th525053545255525054485256were all
turn525054505454to 525054554855cakes as they lay o525054525755loor525151525554a bright
idea came525053484954her head.  `If I eat on525055575556se cakes525055555054
t525150514854, `it's sure to make SOME change in my siz525152535754 as it
can't possibly525054495454me larger, it must 525054495156smaller, I
suppose.'

  So she swallowed o525056495357525056504855 and was delighted to find
that she 525153484954shrinking directly.  As soon as sh525155535554small
enough to get through the door, she ran out 525057514955house, and
found quite a crowd o525153555457animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor525154555656Lizard, Bill, was 525154535455middle, being held up by
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it somethi525148575654 of a bottl525149505154y all made a rush at 525155524954the m525248485354she appeared525248574957
ran off as hard525152505756could525248535456on 525151575354525248494855 safe in a
thick wood.

  `The first thing I've got to do,' said 52515151525552524955534950s she
wandered about 525250565455wood, `is to grow to my right size525250545254;
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
I think that will be the best plan.'

  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
simply arranged; the only difficulty was, 525250545557had not the
525251574954st idea how to set 525156505455t525253495454while s525251534955peering
about anxiously among the trees, a525251535156sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry.

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
ey525256485056feebly stretc52525350494948ne paw, trying to touch her.
`P52525548544949thing!52525252524950, in a coaxing tone525253565155he tried
hard to whistle to it; 525254575555 was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
would be very likely to eat her 525251555454spite of all her 525250524855.

  Hardly knowing wh525254525555did, she picked up 525253565657bit of
stick525349505454held it out to the puppy; whereupon52524955514948 jumped
525348505655e air of525251524954its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
and rushed a52525354505452525157554949made believe to worry it; then Alice
dodged behind a525257555255thistle, to keep herself from being run
over525349575454the moment she appeared 525254515555other side, th525254575355
made an525252535454rush52525452564957tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of 52525552524952, thinking it was very
like having a game of play w525257524854cart-horse525352534954expecting every
525256535055to be trampled under 525348575156, ran round525351575455istle
again52534855495552535050494948began a series of short charges 525353514954525351545156runn525257515154525353495255ttle way forwards each 525354525254nd a long
way bac525352575755barking hoarsely 525355525555 while, till at last it sat
down a good way off, panting525353555455its tongue hanging out of its
mouth525355535354its 525353554954eyes half shut.

  This seemed to Alice525349485756opportunity for ma525350495054er escape;
so she set off a525356575356and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breat525350555355till 525449485157's bark sounded 525350485254faint in the
distance.

  `And yet what a dear525354514956525450525354525356555554!' said525357505056as she
leant against a buttercup to rest 525450484955525450575454fanned herself
with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teach525449545255tricks
very much, if--if I'd only be525448575755right size to do it!  Oh
dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let
me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other; but the 525450505154question is, what?'52545053505452535453554955certainly was525354565655  525451505154looked all round
her 525454515154 flowers525450565054he blades of grass, but she did not see
any525357505454that 525356525755like52544952504949525356485755525448505556 drink under
the circum525452545454s.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,
about the same height as 525453504855; and when she had l525449564954525448535354it525457515554on both si525449575455525357565256behind it, it occurred to her
that she m525449505556well look and see525456564954was on the top of it.

  She stretch52545654524948 up on tipto525549515755peeped over the edge of
the 525452495756525549554954her eyes immediately met those of 525453505055
caterpillar, that was sitting o52545157534948with its arms folded,
quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of a525457495656else.

  52545251574956Advice from a C52545453544948


52555053535452545254514949 and 52555054524952t each525551565054 for some time in
silence:  at las52555253505452545448564950took the 525456494954 out of its
mout525456534955addresse525548495354in a languid, sleepy voice.

  `Who are YOU?' said 52545554514953.

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
at least I know who I WAS525555494954I got up this morning, but I think
I must have been changed several times since then.'525549574855at do you mean by that52555052565051 sternly.
`Explain yourself!525548544954I can't e525548505555MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir525552505155Alice, `because
I'm not myself, you see525550525355I don't see,52555355515055`I525550514857 I 525550555254put it more clearly,' 525556545254525554495155 very
politely, `for 525552485056understand it myself to begin with; and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing525553505356t isn't52555353565057Well, perhaps you haven't found it so ye525552535257Alice; `but
when 525552544956 to turn into a chrysalis--you will525652495454day, you
know--and then after that525553535756butterfly, I should think you'll
feel it a little queer, won't you?'

  `Not a bit52555656565254r feelings may be5256485154494852555751504952

conversation.  525653525354fel52564957484949irritated at 52565652504953's
making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up525557565054aid,
very gravely, `I think525657504854525650485255o tell me who YOU are, first525657575255Why?'52574849555054Here was another puzzling question; and as 525748545554could not
525655524854of any good reason525651555154as 52565448504954seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

  `Come back!' 52565557574955alled after her.  `I've something
important to say!'

  This sounded promising, certainly:525656565456525653504956nd ca525653505555

she could525752525354No52575348545056525655535055hought she might 525654545456wait, as she had nothing else

hearing.  For some minutes it puffe525750485254 without speaking, but
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
again525755485055aid, `So you 525753525354you're changed, do you?'525750565554'm afraid I am, sir525751545156Alice; `I can't remember things as
I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten 525750545056together525754545754`C52574948574952WHAT52574950535553484852505056`Well, I've tri525757545454say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it

wondering what to do next, when 535751555457a footman in livery came
running 53575055504948 wood--(she considered him to be53574848554948
because he was 535748525557:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
she would have call535749505655a fish)--and rapped loudly a535753545454door
with his knuckles.  It was opened by 54484854535553575156494956,
535757504955round face535755505354large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had pow535753505355air that curled all over 535757574954heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about535756505354crept a544851494856way 53575648524953 to listen.

invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog535756524856

  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said544851575054544950535554, `and

545056524956 and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The

and the three565555555155ers instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
look565653515756, eager to see56565053504948.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
like56564955485048, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners:  nex565648515254ten courtiers56564955504950

King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie d565657485654
her face li56575448565052but she could not remember
every hav565749514954ard of such a rule at 56574854514948s; `and besides,

  When the 56575348494948574848495154opposite to Alice, they all stopped
and looked at her57484856554948Queen said severely `Who is this?'
She said it to 56575655525049who only bowed and smiled in

politely; 574849494956added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of

  She was looking 575257504954for some way of escape575354554855ondering

no more of it a575355575155.

not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.

Duchess:  you'd better ask HER575755505254 it.'

  `She's in prison,'4948485350494948 said5757544854554948485357524950:  `fetch
her here.'  A494848545152554948485148504949 went off like an arrow.

   The Cat's head began fading away t494848545650494849484854555055gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King4948485651485657575755504951ran wildly up and
down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back 49484849575155game.

   57575754564956The Mock Turtle's Story


  `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old
thing!' said the Du49484851555055as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alice's49484948555556ey walked off together.

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper 49484949565456
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.

  `When I'M a 49484854485756' she 4948494954495649484852565355, (not in a very
hopeful tone though), `I won't have any 49484853555455in my 49484853525455 AT
ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always 4948485551524949
makes people hot-tempered49484855495555went on, very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinega49484857545755makes them
sour--and camomile th4948485456574951 bitter--and--and barley-sugar
and such things th49484856485555 children sweet49484857534957.  I only wish
49484948485555knew that:  the49484950555255wouldn't be so stingy about it, you
know--'

  She had quite forgotten the 49484954564855 by this time, and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close49484954555155 ear.
`You're thinking about something, my dear4948495656555649484951565757you
forget to talk.  I 49485048575655ell you just now what the moral of that
is, but I shall remember i49484956535055bit.'

  `P4948504850564948hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.

  `Tut, tut, child!' said t4948495352544948.  `Everything's got a
moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed 49485051545056up
closer to Alice's side as she spoke.

  Alice did not much like keeping so 4948495649504950:  first,
because th4948495752574948was VERY ugly; and secondly, b49484952574955she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon4948495548534948houlder,
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she 49484956494955
like to be rude, so she bore it as well 49484957514855could49485049485055he game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of
k49485048525455up the conversation a little.

  `'Tis so,' s4948505150514953:  `and th4948505348534953 is--"Oh,
'tis love, 49484956514849484948505454484950the world go round!"'

  `Somebody said,49485054495156whispered, `that it's done by everybody
minding their own business!'

  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,4948505649554956,
digging her sharp little chin in49485056485349504948505449515549485056505256added,
4948505248564956THAT is--"Take care of the sense, 49485053484855
sounds will ta4948505049484952mselves.49485053485355How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to
49485150495655.

  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your
waist,' 4948515055514950said after a pause:  `the reason is49485057515555I'm
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the
experiment?49485055525455E might bite,49485148574956cautiously replied, not feeling at all
anxious to have the 4948505453504948 tried.

  `Very true,' 494851525057504849485055565356es and mustard both

have of putting things!'

  `It's a mineral, I THINK49485155515556Alice.

  `Of course it is,4948515649554957 who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said; `there's a large49485151555056-mine near

less 4948514949544950your49485248505157Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this
last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it

more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than

politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it
as you say it49485250505055That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' 4948525557514949
replied, in a pleased tone.

  `Pray don't trouble4948525057574948to say it any longer than that,'

a present of 4948534849514949I've said as yet49485255555655A cheap sort of 49485248574955!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad the49485251485555
give birthday 49485250495155s like that!'  But she did not venture to
say it out loud.

  `Thinking again?4948525355544951 asked, with another dig of her
sharp little chin.

  `I've a right to think4948535054545649485257495055harply, for she was

fly; and the m--'

  But here, to Alice's great surprise, t4948534952484948's voice died
away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' 49485254555355
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,
and there stood the Queen in front of them49485349495755her arms folded,
frowning like a thunderstorm.

  `A fine day, your Majesty!' th4948535149494948began in a low, weak
voice.

  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shoute4948534850494949, stamping on
the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off49485350485456at in about half no time!  T49485357514955r choice!'

  Th4948535553574948took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said t49485355485255; and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her
back to the croquet-ground.

  The other guests had taken advantage of 49485356495357's absence,
and were resting 49485448505255shade:  however, the moment they saw her,
they hurried b4948535257564949game,4948544853504949merely remarking that a
moment's delay would cost them their lives.

  All the time they were playing th49485450555456never left off

taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that 49485355565155end of half an hour
or so there were no 49485356505155left, and all the 49485448525457except the
King,494854555557495049485453525457, were in 49485448525656and under 49485449494856 of

  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a4948544857534951is.'

  `It's the thing 4948544954554950Soup is made from4948544957555649485549525157.

history,'

  As they walked off together, Alice49485452485555the King say in a low
voice, 49485550565155company generally, `You are all pardoned.'49485453525655,
THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of 49485548534857s the Queen had ordered.49485549485255y very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
sun.  (IF you don't 494855495155495049485454534855 is, look 49485455545355picture.)
`Up, lazy th494854565649554948554948555048take this young lady to
see4948555250524954, and to hear his history.  I must go back and
see after some 4948554855524949I have 49485548564955'; and she 4948555153544948,
leaving Alice alone with the 49485549544855.  Alice did no49485551484955 like
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
be49485557565055as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen:  so49485550505155ite4948555353515749485552555157sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight4948554955524949chuckled.  `What fun!'

  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' 49485556525056Alice, as she went
slowly49485648555655it:  `I never was so 49485652485355 about in all my life,
never!'

  They had not gone far before they saw 494856515453495349485653505756distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
as they came nearer, Alice could49485653555356m sighing as if his heart
would break.  She pitied him deeply49485650565557is his sorrow?' she
asked 4948565152494951and t4948565348534949answered, very nearly 49485648535355same words as before, 4948565156554949is 4948565248524952he hasn't got

large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.

  `This here young lady,4948565650554956, `she wants for to
know your history, she do.'

  `I'll tell it her49485657575249504948565552494953a deep, hollow
tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've
finished.'

t49485750495255to herself, `I49485652525456ee how he can EVEN finish, if he
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.

  `Once,4948565550505051at last, with49485655535155 sigh, `I was
a real49485752504955.'

  These49485749555755were followed by a very long silence, broken only
by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from 4948575254484954
the constant heavy sobbing of t494857515555495249485748515156 was very
nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your
interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come, so she sat still and sa4948575456574954When we were little,' 4948575451524954went on 49485751545357more
calmly, though4948574851485549485750515356a little now and then, `we went to
school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call
him Tortoise--'

  `Why did you call hi494857495050494849485756515055 wasn't one?' Alice asked.

  `We called 4948575052504950 because he taught us4949485051564954

  `You 49494849565757be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,' added the 49494848524855;49485755485457 they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At

little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day

very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'

across his eyes.  He looked at 4949515351494949tried to speak, but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone

again:--

  `No, indeed,49495254505055Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'

  `Why,4949525050514956, `you first form into a line along the

  `Two lines!' cried t4949525449544952.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,

4949525450554950 suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
who had been jumping about like mad thing49495255545456is time, sat
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

  `It must be a very pretty dance49495257545456Alice timidly.

  `Would you like to see a little of it?49495348575349484949535655544951

  `Oh, YOU sing494953534957494949495448525357  `I've forgotten the words.'

  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
49495354575355n treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while t4949545148494952
sang this, very slow49495356555755sadly:--


`"Will you walk 49495356505757faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's tr4949535454504948my

  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said
Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so
like that curious song about t4949555353554948!'

  `Oh, as to 494955544951494949495457535455 the Mock Turtle, `they--you've
seen them, of course?'

  `Yes4949545753525649495549485055`I've often 49495457554857 at dinn--' she

if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

sounds uncommon nonsense.'

again.

  `I should like to have it explained4950495757545051.

    4950525554544956Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seat49505348535457ir throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, 49505349535355soldier on
each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment49505448494955
other.  In the very middle 49505450555455court was a table49505353525557large
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
quite hungry to look a49505355495156`I wish they'd get the trial done,'
she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed
to be no chanc49505354545155is, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
rea4950545054574950 in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly 4950535653574949there.  `That's the
judge,' she said to herself, `because of his49505454495355wig.'

  The judge, by the way, w49505454495255King; and as he wore his crown
over the wig, (4950545154484949 frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it,) he did not 49505452575756all comfor49505454515255and it was certainly
not becoming.

as well.

`What 49505455575455y doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  `They
can't have an49505552505456o put down yet, before the trial's begun.'

  `They're putting down their names,' 49505455535549494950545557514949in
reply, `for fear they should forge495055564949554950545651504949end of the
trial49505456535655Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but
she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in
the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round, to make out who was talk49505557545256Alice could see, 49505553545255 as if she were looking over their
shoulders49505555555755all 4950555751554948 were 49505554565056down `st4950555250484951

away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was
Bill, the Lizard)49505555564849494950565053495749505649545455what had become of

with one finger 49505654485056rest49505649495656day; and this was of very
49505557545055use, as it left no mark on the slate.

  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King49505651555555 this 4950565748574955blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
          All on a summer day:49505648564855The Knave4950564952574950he stole those4950564956514957nd took them quite away!'

  `Consider your verdict,' the King49505653495255o the jury.

  `Not yet, not yet!' th49505653545757hastily interrupted.  `There's

  The 4950565354504951 was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg
pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I
hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'

  `You ought to have 495056555348564950574856544954.  `When did you

the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I
think it was,' he said.

I'll have you executed on the spot.'

  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept
shifting from one foot 49514852545355other, looking uneasily 49514848514855Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was

would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
decided to remain where 49514851485155 as long as there was room for

sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'

  `I can't help it49514952504956Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing49514852505155You've no right 49514855535456here495149505148495049514853555756.

  `Don't talk nonsens49514951495457Alice more boldly:  `you know
you're 49514854495655 too.'

  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pa495149534956495249514856545556:
`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily
and crossed over4951495353514951 side49514952554956court.

  All this time the Queen had never left off staring 49514954565755Hatter, and, just as the495149505649574951485748575749514952545557, she said to

trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

you executed, whether 49514954505555nervous or not49514956534856'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a49514951534955ing voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week

  The miserabl49515151515057dropped his teacup and 4951515057514954,

suppressed by the officers49515056565156court.  (As that is rather a
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
into this they slipped 4951505750544952, head first, and then sat
upon it.)

  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
attempts at applause495151495055564951515149504953 s4951515151484954

  The4951515648524951 was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the
pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she got in4951524856535549515250575155by the way the people near49515249545357 began
sneezing all at once.

  For some minutes the whol49515351574955 was in confusion, getting the

Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU49515355515750484951534854484955

  Alice watched the 4951535754574950 as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see wh495154494953554951535153534950 would be like,

  `Here!' cried Alice, quite for49515449554956in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown49515353515056last few 49515451545255, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tippe4951544854544949jury-box with
the edge of her skirt, upsetting 49515451565356jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish 49515448505556accidentally upset
the week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone 49515456545456
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,

49515548515355`until 4951545551564954are 49515451505655 their proper places--
ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said do.

  Alice looked at 4951545355534952and saw that, 49515455505356aste, she
had put the Lizard in head downward49515550574855the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
it signifies much,' s49515456554956to herself; `I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the49515549575455one way up as the other.'

  As soon 49515455495755jury4951555250545549515548494855recovered from the shock of
being upset49515556535357ir slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
out a history 4951555651535549515556535756, all except 4951555253564948, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up4951555753574948roof 49515649485755court.

  `What do you know about this business?' 4951564850555749515553575255
Alice.

  `Nothing495156494852564951554953564956 WHATEVER?' persisted 495156495750564951555049574952whatever4951555056494957That's very important,4951555157544953, turning 49515553485355jury.
They were just begin49515551505756write this down on4951555655544951, when
the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UN4951555350494948 your Majesty means,
of course,' 49515653525156in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
making faces at him as he spok4951555657495549515554525049514951555451504948 I mean4951555652484951hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, `49515557564857--un4951555451484949
49515554525349514951555456484949' as if he were trying which word
sounded best.

  Some 49515653505455jury wrote it down 4951555654544948,' and some
`4951555748494949.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
look over4951565657544951; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
thought to herself.

  A49515655524855moment 49515655534956, who had been for some time busily
writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out
from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE

  Everybody looked at 4951574955494949I'M not a mile high4951575050494957You are,' said t4951575051554952early two miles high,' added the Queen.

  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate4951575156514951:  `besides,

`Consider your verdict,' he said to 49515752495356, in a low, trembling
vo49515748535357There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has

as he spoke, and added 49515751555049484951575448564948after all:  it's a set

  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the

  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
said 49525053524856, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'

  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (49524957525555
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll gi49525052575755sixpence.  _I_ don't
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'

  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't 49524956534955

  `If 49525048525056no49524957535149554952505153544953`that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
4952505349504949them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

  `All right, so far4952505653534956and 4952505555544948 muttering
over4952505648514950to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's
the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY49525053505555IM TWO--" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, 4952515049575649525154575756But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said
Alice.

  `Why, there they are!4952515256554953 triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts49525155515455 table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.

the court with a smile.  There was a dead silen49525157515656It's a pun!' 49525157525457added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day49525248525755o, no4952524855504955.  `Sentence first--49525154505255 afterwards.'

  `Stuff and nonsense49525252515556Alice loudly.  `The idea of having

size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

  At this the whole pack rose up in49525348495155air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a 49525348485255scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, 4952525349534951 in the la49525253495257sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees 49525252575456 face49525255495255ake up, Alice dear495253485457564952525250544948; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had49525348515355Oh, I49525251535555 such a curious dream4952534956504951, and she told
4952525453544950as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of her49525255544955you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, 4952525753544948 kissed her49525255535155aid, `It WAS a
4952525650574951, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran4952534852494948she might49525349565457wonderful dream it had been.

  But 4952534850574949sat still just 49525350485655left her, leaning her
head 49525352535255hand, watching the setting sun, and t49525348555756of
49525356485355Alice and all her 49525349485249484952535249514948, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion49525349484857s was her dream:--

  First, she dreamed of 495253495750495149525448514855, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped 49525357565257knee49525351544956e bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--4952535751564948hear the very tone49525357524856

the wandering hair that WOULD always get49525352554857 eyes--and
still 49525356555256istened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange crea495254524950495049525356535255
sister's dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool4952544853565049rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
a49525451495255shrill voice49525356524956Queen or49525450505355off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the

filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull realit49525457575755grass would be only
rustling in the wind, 49525457495756pool rippling to the wav4952545553504948
reeds--the rattling t495255494957554952545352534954tinkling sheep-

  Lastly, she pictured to 49525551575056how this same little sister of
hers would, 49525551534955after-time, be 49525553515656a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  49525548555155 she would gather about
her4952555253555549525550505755children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
