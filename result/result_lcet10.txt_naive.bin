various projects and interest groups to compare ideas, beliefs,

historical textual materials in computerized form.  Most attendees gained
much in insight and outlook from5152505553event.  But the assembly did not
form a new n5152575053, or, to put it an5152564853 way, the diversity of p5150515555

Three non49485655525449485754524948s described approaches to preparing

Membe494854535054the American Memory team 494855545154e staff of NAL's Text
Digitization Program (see below)494951515054outlined a middle ground concerning
494855515354494948495357s.  In the 49485756565649485550494953, contractors produce
texts with about 99-percent accuracy that serve as "browse" or

THE MACHINE-READABLE TEXT:  METHODS OF CONVERSION

Although the Workshop did not include a systematic examination 495050515154
methods for converting texts from paper (or from 49495453564954) into
machine-read495050515256m, nevertheless, various speakers touched upon this
matter.  For example, WEIBEL report494955575756OCLC has experimented 495049564854
merging of multiple optical character recognition 494955525054s that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 549495357554948s out of every
l,000 to a49495449575051249495452525052 l,000.

Pamela ANDRE presented an overview of NAL's Text Digitiz495049525354Program and
Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  494955544954explained how NAL
purchased hardware and software capable of performing o49504957514954

OPTIONS FOR DISSEMINATION

Workshop.  At the session devoted to 495148515254al and int495157505354onal computer
networks, LYNCH, Howard BESSER, Ronald LARSEN, and Edwin BROWNRIGG

CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods. 
The more committed 50495054544950equently communicate with others 504954575354ir
504951525354, but less often across group boundaries.  50495351494955also

Still, reality rears its ugly head:  no breakthrough has been achieved.

data-interchange standards and a lack of consensus o505056535654role of digital

impediment to the desire, as it is sometimes expressed 505057534854 popular

determination may be made that there is a50565354534953 item, or a

course, to 505750485755more tha505656515354earchable text.

As AM conside505751555154ose qu505751554955, several conceptual issues505752504854:  ought
AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely 505656555056an image set, at
other times, 50565550564956 text505655515655nd 505749484956cases, a mix?

items.  Implicit in his remarks, 51484853574951conceded, was the admission
that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
little from 505753555356514852555255.  Th505754564856t seemed to AM that societ514849485155
be better served if 514852495755ings were distributed by LC--even if they were
not quite 505756545455--than if fewer505754495555, 505757505655ly represented, were
50575456504949.  This was stated 514850515455oposition to be tested, with
responses 505754555454gathered from users.

In thinking about issues related 514856495655514850545057of materials and seeing514856524855people engaged in parallel activities, AM deemed it useful to
convene a conference.  Hence514853525254Workshop.  51485256544951thereupon
surveyed the several groups re514850555457:  1) the world of images (image

this group, those concerned with language--51485749514954fess514855565454finding
delightful irony in the fact514856545256me of the most advanced514854535354ers on

nominal triennial licensing fee.

Playing with the disk for an hour or so51505355554949 brought home to DALY
at once the revolutionizing impact 515057575655new technology on his previous
methods of research.  Ha51505348534950been available two or three years
earlier, DALY contended, when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on
Book 10 of Virgil's Aeneid for Cambridge 51514952544948 Press, he would not
have required a forty-eight-square-foot table on which to spread the
numerous, most frequently consulted items, including some ten or twelve
concordances to key 515151555654authors, an515151545756equal number of lexica to

525455504855.  Beyond 52545056484956, MICHELSON remarked the delivery of
commercial full-text 525454535254ts, such as articles in professional 525449525557
newsletters, magazines, wire services, and re525453515555 sources.  These are
being 525450574855ed via on-line local library catalogues, especially through
CD-ROMs.  Furthermore, according to 525453504957, there is general optimism

MICHELSON summarized this sec525652535754y noting two striking changes taking
place in 525750485255ly commun525749515055525654525054 humanities 525750565455s.  First is the
extent to which 52575052574954in part525751495654, and 52575149524949525657495457
in general, are be525750494854fused into each525654515656five processes described
above.  As mentioned earlier, there is a certain synergy at work here. 
The 52575253525552565453565048 for one 525654514855 tends to stimulate its
use for other52565550504948, 525751495256the chief 525750564855of move525749495254s toward a

s525755574854, analytical tools, and publi525756515754s.  52575256534948noted further
that the 525748545257525748545756 com52574949495156
52574951505048is not new.  In fact, it has been525756505454way for more
than forty years in the 52575553504948, since Father Roberto Busa began525757575256ing an 52575649564949concordance 534848525655534848575154of Saint Thomas Aquinas

second stri534849525554hange is the ext525757575054 which research and edu534848575654
net525756514954are becoming the new medium of 53485053504948communication.  The
existing Internet and the pending National E525754565256 and R525755505356N525755495654

The trend toward53495153524957 is significant to consider534952545355f

general readers;535657535256students who use AM 53565551505553565452564955
those in fourth grade and above seem most interested.  P53574853544953
53565449574948ites tend to attract retired people, who 53565248564948highly
receptive to AM.  Users 535649524956fall into two additional categories:

What kind535657554855ings do users do with AM?  In a 53575448484951y there are
two main goals or ways t535753575755is being used:  as an individual learning
tool535750505154as a leisure activity.  Adult 535655575456 was one area that 535756485454
would highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM.  She
535756575256d a patron of a 53575555515453574954484953who comes in every day on
his lunch hour and literally reads AM, methodically go535754575154rough the
collection image by image.  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic
bookmark, puts it in his pocket535757575354returns to work535757575655next day he

VECCIA made the final point544957484854in many cases AM serves as a544956535355-relations tool for the 54495750544955that are testing it.  In
one case, AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for

are systems like AM truly rewarding in a 545556535255environment, or do they

55485552515552
During the discus554949515554hat followed the presenta554852505754by MICHELSON,
VECCIA, and FREEMAN,55485348554950points emerged.

LESK asked if 554851505757 could give any 55494852494950 estimate554856485755

she offered her impres554951525254as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has d554948565754ed this issue with other a554855505656554955505754perform

opposed to, say, undergraduate papers, were few in 554952485654, especially
given the public interest in using 55494948574953 to conduct

re554957575355done by people in private industry 554955495755federal government. 
More important in 555048495157's view was that, 55495755494950ly, nothing is
known about the ways in which, for example, 55504856505048are using
information technology.  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies.  The most recent study was 554955515555ed in 1985 by the American
Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), and what it showed w554955515555 50
percent of 55495549535049t that time were 555048545154computers.  That
constitutes the exte554954495254our knowledge.

Concerning AM's 554956515555y for orienting p555049535454towar555050505154scope of
electronic res555053505554, FREEMAN could 555048515354no hard conclusions554956565554is
point, because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see,
particularly in 554957514854hools, what has been made of their efforts.  Within
the system, however, AM has provide555051495155are called e55504952524948exhibits-

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the s555154545454.  Reflecting on
DALY's opening comments on how he co555249505757used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form, he sai555248525455at first he 555157524954t most 555249525355s

applica55525451485555525451494950texts.  He realized that AM55525657504948555255544854s a
guide to lead someone to 555254535557sources.  Students cannot be expected
to have 55525549574953555250545655, things they have never known about
before.  Thus, AM is lead555256534856, 555350485254ory, to a vast body of
in555256525554ion and giv555257545557a superficial overview of it, enabli555348535255

these new tools.  But he wondered why 555255545456 would go beyond picking
out55534951544948at were most exciti555352505654them.

555352515655 conceded the correctness of 55535457504948's observa555350504954s appli555351565654a school environment.  The risk is that a s555353494854555348515255sit down at a
system, play with it, find some555353554856of interest, and then walk away. 
But 555353565754 relatively controlled situ555356575757555349554957library, much will
depend on the instructions a555353574854er or a 555349494854ian gives55535148514948.  She
view55535755515455535050504949not as one of fine-tuning 555354565457skills but of
involving 555354565657at a personal level in understanding and 555356575256555356525154ings.  Give555353515254guidance one can receive at 555355525654, it then becomes
possible to teach elementary55535350564955to s555449555657which in fact

55544953554950luded that introduc555453535055 idea of following one's own path
of inquiry, 555354565155s essentially what 555453495457entails, 555357554954es more
than 555355535757specific555448535755.  To these comments VECCIA ad555453524955
o55545350544949that 555451484954dividual 555451495256555452535155 use of a creative
resource, rather than AM itself, seemed to make the key difference.
Some 555455554854s a555454575757555453544954s are making excellent 555357545555the nature

Concurring with 555450504854remarks, DALY clos555455575356ession 555448484856 thought that

The PLD project was based on574954525055inciple that 575053515756575053525556ng of
575050515554is most effective when it is done with a larg57504953504948.  Because
PLD represented a collecti574955565657erves so many disciplines across so
many periods, it was irresistible.

The basic rule in575052545456ing PLD was 575052515654no harm, to avoid575054515754ins of
intrusion in such a 575053574856:  no intr57505148514949 newer editions, no
on-the-spot changes, no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an
e574957505654.  Thus, PLD is not the final act in 57505256544949575052554955ing for
this 57505054564948, but simply the beginning.  The 575050555254sion of PLD has
evoked numerous unanticipated questions:  How will 57505555484950be used? 
What about 57514853484948575056575655the rights of a575056525557 be protected?

particular, causes problems in cre575152575454a search structure), 575056505455
indices, and even the 575148525256which are being scanned in separately

Several North American institu575151495454that have placed acquisition requests
for the PLD 575154495557have 575057485555ed it in magnetic form without software,

The en57515752495557515751554949base was also a hard-fought issue:  Did the

eliminate, as much as possible575253535454hindrances to information-networking,
so that if an institution acquires 575348515654base, everybody associated with

Since the 4948484950504949came4948484852504948Revolutionary War period, a 575754505155was
conducted using the words British or war, with the default operator reset

other forms of the same root) and a truncated49484848505455.  One 5757554855494957575555484948's strongest features, the relevance ranking, was represented by
a chart that indicated how often 575755535354being sought appeared in
documents, 575756504857one receiv575756565556most "hits" obtain575757515756highest

account, making the first hit, 49484853555157575757544954one the s49484853495356has

remarked AM's attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to 575757564856s,
which it does in different ways 57575750574951manifestations.  In the case
shown, 57575754575449484848555057was pasted on:  AM took MARC records that were
written as on-line records right into4948485153534950Library's mainframe

who massage49484850515255somewhat to display them 49484854545455manner shown49484949504957
AM's questions is, Does 4948485354524949uing normally performed in4948485156505549484853505456work in this context, or had AM ought to think through adjustments?

4948485755504950 made the additional point that, as far49484949535356text goes, AM
has gravitated towards SGML (he pointed to the boldface 49484950555055upper part
49484950565755screen).  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate
or interpret SGML, Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics
on49484856495155; a fairly easy th49484953515755do, but it is 494849545651494949484953535756which
SGML is useful.

Striking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern
of AM, with accuracy being 4948495754554949places where project staff have
felt that less than 100-percent 49484948505557was not unacceptable. 
4948495354504951cited the exampl49484957515657standard49484957554856rekeying industry,
namely 99.95 percent; as one service bureau in49484956565555him, to go from
99.95 to 10049484949574956 would double49485049524855st.

4948495751544951next demonstrated how AM 49484955525255es users recourse to images,
and at the same time recalled LESK's 494850485256564948505148575649484955515756ing the
number of people who would look at those images and the 4948495248575549484952485657
work only with 49485051515656.  If the implication of 4948495355565549484953555757was
sound, 4948505349564951said, it rais49484957535755stakes for text 49485049525357and
reduced the value4948504853524948rategy for images.

Contending that preservation is always a bugaboo4948495554564952
4948504854564951several 49484957515655derived from a scan of a 4948495555534950
microfilm that AM had made.  He awarded a grade of C at best, perhaps a
C minus or a C plus, for how well it worked out.  Indeed, the matter of
learning if other49485051565156had better ideas about scanning in general, and,
in particular, 49484957535757from 49485049555757, w4948505650505549485148515255factors that drove
AM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop.  Skew, for
494851494850554948504955554955issues49485052545057in its ignorance had not reckoned
would prove so difficult.

Further, the handling of 4948514848525549485056515056ort shown, in a desktop computer
environment, involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling. 
Ultimately, AM staff feel that p49485056575655the paper copy that is printed out
might be the most useful one, but they remain uncertain as to how much
on-screen reading users will do.

Returning to the text4948515352534953asked viewers to imagine a person who4948505550524948conducting a search in a full-text 4948505753574949.  With this
scenario, he proceeded to illustrate49485152535455features of Personal Librarian
that he 49485149525256ed helpful; for 49485151574857it provides the ability to
notice words as one reads.  Clicking the "include" button on the bottom
o49485152555155earch window pops the words that have been highlighted into the
search.  Thus, a user can refine 4948514851544949as he or sh49485149515155,
re-execut4948514953535649485148505156nd continu49485153495555find things in the quest for
materials.  This software not only contains relevance ranking, Boolean
operators, and truncation, it also permits one to perform word algebra,
so to say, where one puts two or three49485154545555in parentheses and links
them with one 49485152505155 o49485152515055 and then a couple of 49485151565057another set
of 4948515250564954asks for 49485154565255within so many words of others.

Until they became acquainted recently with some 49485248525155work being done in
classics, the AM staff had not realized that a large number of the
projects that involve electronic texts were 4948515548484949by people with a
profound interest in language 49485248505155guistics.  Their search strategies
and thinking are oriented to those fields, as is shown in particular by
the Perseus49485255575156.  As amateur historian4948524949504954were 49485157515656
more of searching for concepts and ideas than for 4948524848534949words. 
Obviously, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, 4948524851575151and4948534849505549485248575256words may be two rather closely relate49485348485756.

While displaying several images, 4948525049514951observe49485254525255the Macintosh
prototype built by AM 49485349545157a greater diversity of formats.  Echoing a
previous speaker, he said49485256525555t was easier to stitch 49485348575455together in
4948525248564951, though it tended to be a little more anemic in search and
retrieval.  AM, therefore, increasingly has been investigating
sophisticated 49485252545757 engines in the IBM format.

4948525754554951demonstrated 49485256555256additional examples of the 49485256565657
interfaces:  One was AM's metaphor for the network future, in which a
kind of reading-room graphic suggests how one would be able to go around
to different materials.  4948535051484952large number of photographs in
analog video form worked up from a videodisc, which enable users to make
copies to print or incorporate in digital documents.  A frame-grabber is
built into the system, making it possi49485349545555bring an image into a window

hours of audio, as AM has 49485354484956d it49485356485356occupy 150 megabytes on a

normally would do in 49485357535056ing a4948545155485052raises several
questions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can
afford to add and at what point, perhaps, this becomes more than AM could
reasonably do or 4948535748484949wish to do.  F4948545652574950also4948545654544951
a motion picture.  As FREEMAN had reported earlier, the 4948544853494952
materials have proved the most popular, not surprisingly.  This says more
about the medium, he thought, than about AM's presentation of it.

49485650505755ation, several clarifications were made.

AM is bringing 4948565057564956 from a 49485649495157494856505253554948564956564951

digitize a 49485651515655frame of the movie or on49485553505157photographs.  It
produces a crude, rough-and-ready image that high school students can
incorporate into papers, and that has worked very nicely in this way.

Commenting on 4948564949544952 assertion that AM was looking more at
searching ideas than words, MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
does not exist.  4948565157524950 conced49485557485656he ought to have articulated
his point more clearly.  49485648525256stated that they were in fact both
talking about the same thing.  By 4948565050564948for 49485649575656d by forcing

all of them 4948574956534948ic.  In the Macintosh environment, for example,

The purpose of AM within the 49485754544955, it is hoped, is to catalyze several
49485756495755other49485755494957494948504954494849485755524957s which have no particular
experience with, in some cases, mixed feelings about, an activity such as
AM.  Moreover, in many cases the 4948575552554948may be characterized as not
only lacking 4948575649534949in "49494848565257fying" things but also in automated
cataloguing.  MARC 4948575553534949 as practiced 49494853535755United States is
heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
materials, but is much thinner when one enters49494856505456ld of manuscripts

units.  In response to a comment by LESK, that AM's m49494850515055 is very494948515148574949494951544948ic, and is so primarily because individual records have
been made for each 4949494849564948, FLEISCHHAUER observed that an item-level

state, which will then serve as an umbrella for the 100-2004949494848524948

is conservative and clings to 4949495748494949, though of course visitors tout
artificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that
49494950525656one need not have 4949494857574949 o49494948505155much of it could be put aside.

The matter of SGML coding, 4949495748524951conceded, returned the discussion
to the earlier treated quest49494957495655quality versus quantity 49495048495155Library

accuracy, but it means that when one's holdings are as vast as LC's only
a tiny amount will be exposed, whereas permitting lower levels of

Finding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSON's from the morning
session--that numerous people49495057565556humanities were choosing 4949505354564948
o49495053555555to do their work--Dorothy TWOHIG, editor, The Papers of George
4949505456534948, opened her illustrated talk by noting that her 4949505655504948

Massachusetts Historical Society, and Madison down the hall from her at

like all 4949515552575549495148524856, include both sides 494951565049554949515349544948

the transcription of thousands of 4949515757524948waiting 49495248495656t on disk in

the 49505752495249504950575151524949books is mostly out of copyright and thus
offers an opportunity to work with material that 49505755525255s 49505755565155

with this in49505757565157, 4950575656504948noted that several things are being
done:  the prima49514850544949544950575454494949used today is photocopying of
b495148495156554950575348574949Saving the intellectual content of the 49505755485657is the
main goal.  With microfilm copy, 4950575255575053is preserved on
the assumption that in the future the image can be4951485355574948ed in any
other way that then exists.

4951495149514949is that the preferred means of find4951495351505649514953495157will be by
looking 495148544948574951485755504951PERSONIUS described the scanning process,
which uses a prototyp495148535553554951485555505749514952575555ed by Xerox and which scans a
very high resolution image at great speed.  A49514952505755significant feature,
because this is a preservation 4951495554534949, is the placing of the pages
that fall apart one for one 49514954505355platen.  Ordinarily, a 49514948525356could
be used with some sort of a document feeder, but because of this
4951494853494949 that is not feasible.  Further, b49514949545555CLASS is a

a new 4951505153545649514952485155 produced:  The49514952505457images are rebound by a
commercial binder and a new 49514952484956returne49514953565457shelf.

in effect, the equivalent of 4951505155504951photocopies.  Thus, the project
has a l49514957504955of digital books.  In essence, 4951505148535749515055525757and

Robert ZICH, special assistant to the associate librarian for 49515648535555

the blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very

leaning in that direction, while lacking anyone to speak from the

Clifford LYNCH, director, Library Automation, University of California,
opened his talk with the general observation that4952505750525050
constituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just
starting to develop and n49525148485555fully understood.  LYNCH contended that
creating genuinely 4952505453535050was d49525055515556 from using49525055535156s as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated
and more subtle.  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate,
from what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects, to what
sort of a world of electronics 4952515153534949--scholarly, archival,
cultural, etc.--they wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now. 
LYNCH suggest49525056535655495250545554495349525149545455ly from these 49525054545756 would
produce unpleasant results.

Putting the issue of CD-ROM in perspective before getting into
49525151524855ities on 4952515154495049, LYNCH observ49525056495357hose engaged
in 4952515455564948 today who wish to ship a49525155535455t, so to say, probably do
not have much choice except to use CD-ROM:  49525154575249484952505656534949on a
large scale basically does 49525154564956work49525155544857the technolog4952505656484948
exist.  For example, anybody who has tried moving images around over the
Internet knows that this is an exciting touch-and-go process, a
fascinating and fertile area for experiment49525152544955research, and
development, but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic
about commi49525155544855o production systems a49525151564855time.

This situation will change49525156484956said.  He differentiated 49525157525355from
the practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on
CD-ROM49525155575055LYNCH the problem with 49525249565456s not its portability or its
slowness but the two-edged sword of hav49525251535356retrieval application and
the user interface inextricably bound up with the data, which is the
typical49525253535756publ49525154534956model.  It is not a case of publishi49525156565155
but of 4952515750574951a typically stand-alone, 4952515455514948closed system,
all--software, 4952515749534952, and data--on a little disk.  Hence, all
the between-disk navigational issues as well as the impossibility in most
cases of integra4952525154564950 one disk 49525250485555at on another.  Most49525253515155
4952525152554948495252495052564952534850514948network very gracefully at present.  However,
in the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of
what 49525249545356information is or what the ground rules are for creating or
using it, 49525254535449494952525049544950on a 49525348545055does add value in a very
real sense.

LYNCH drew a contrast4952525456495649525350495056and 49525253525756pricing and in doing so
highlighted something bizarre in 495252535350495049525251555755.  A large
institution such 49525257485055University of California has vendors who will
offer to sell 495252554850495349525353485055for a price per year in four digits,
but for the same data (e.g., an abstracting and index49525352535456base) on
magnetic tape, regardless of how many people may use it concurrently,
will quote 49525256485556in six49525256494855.

What is packaged 49525352554955e 49525356485355in one sense adds value--a complete
access 49525355564855 not just raw, unrefined 4952535254514949--although it is not
generally perceived that way.  This is because the 4952525754485649525355565755,
49525257525449504952534852514948, is viewed by some49525350495055, particularly in the
u4952535348484948environment where there is a very heavy commitment to
49525448544855ing, as being developed in the wrong direction.

Given that context, 49525357515655escribed the examples demonstrated as a set of
insular4952545049484951gems--Perseus, for 49525350514955, offers nicely linked
in49525450534857, but would be very difficult to integrate with other
49525357555756s, that is, to link together seamlessly 4952535154514948 source files
from4952535153574951s.  It resembles an island, an49525355505455is respect is
similar to numerous stand-alone projects that are based on videodiscs,
49525354545457on the single-workstation concept.

As scholarship evolves in a network4952544953574950, the paramount need will
be t4952535657565549525357515357.  We must link personal4952535454514948 to public4952544852544951o group 4952544856534949in fairly 49525448565556 ways--which is
extremely 4952545050564948495254525252554952545352554949s under discussion with copies of
4952535752524948proliferating all over the place.

The notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the
495254515553574952545550554950.  S495253575451554952545051564948in a sense constitute
4952545648524950archives without a significant amount of navigation built in. 
Educators, critics, and others will want a layered structure--one that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach
specific points.  In LYNCH's view, 49525453555757will become increasingly
necessary, and not just within a single resource but across 49525451505356s
(e.g., tracing mythology and cultural themes across 49525456525756classics4952545756534949as well as a 49525550504856 of Renaissance49525453495455e).  This ability to
organiz4952545452574948s, to build things out of multiple other49525453525357n the
network or select pieces of it, represented for49525550565755one of the key
aspects of n495255545650554952555055534949.

Contending that4952545456494950 reuse4952555156494949d another 4952555156494950issue,
LYNCH commended to the audience's attention Project NEEDS (i.e., National
Engineering Education Delivery System4952554957535749525555525755's objective is to
produce a4952555149574951en4952545755494948courseware4952555248494950the components
that can be used to develop new 4952554850534948.  In a number 49525551545755existing
applications, LYNCH said, the issue of reuse (how much one can take apart
and reuse in other 4952554956534950) was not being well considered.  He also
raised t4952555056504950active versus passive use, one aspect of which  is
49525551565457495255564848495049525650525555 manipulated locally by users.  Most people,
he argued, may do a little browsing and the49525552505355wish to print.  LYNCH
was uncertain how these 49525652544857 would 49525556545356by the vast majority of
users in the 49525651535456environment.

LYNCH next said a few words about X-Windows as a way of differentiating
between 49525653544856access and 49525653575555ed 4952565351524950  A49525650495149524952565049554951 demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X
across 4952555750544949, so that one could run them from any X-capable device-
-a workstation, an X terminal--and transact with49525655515649504952555752524948
49525649575255.  Although this opens up 4952564953495649525652495255, assuming one has enough49525557545456 to handle it, it does not provide an interface 4952565754484949a
program that conveniently integrates in4952565555564948from multiple d49525650525755s. 
X is a viewing technology that has limits.  In a real sense, it is just a
graphical version of remote log-in 4952565450544956.  X-type4952575054504951

4952574856504952The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide
the ability for comput49525653545156alk to each other, retrieve4952575152494950,
and shuffle it around fairly casually.  At the moment, little49525656525357 is
being made on 4952565551574948for 4952575357495049; for example, 49525748505355

LYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider,
as well as several comments about what might co49534851524856 good trial

extensive control over the integrity of the presentation; strange
programs "munge" with one's data before the user sees it4953485256514948
thought must be given to what guarantees 49534849505349514953484951514950.  Part
of that is related to where one draws the boundaries around 4953485252534949
495348525356495049534852515355.  This ques4953494848485649534851575349504953485251544949in
client-server computing has not been stressed enough in the academic
world, LYNCH argued, though commercial 49534855535656providers deal with it
regularly.

costs therefore can be amortized among large numbers of user49534953575055this

place to start, because it tends to 49534857564855longer life span than much of
the scientific49534857505157, as well as a wider user base.  LYNCH noted, for
example, that American Memory fits man49534957565157criteria outlined.  He
remarked the extensive discussion about bringing the Internet or the
National Research and Education Network (NREN) into the K-12 environment
as a way of helping the 49534951505757ed49534950484855al system.

him as excellent justific49534950565455of broad-scale networking for K-12, but
that at this time no "killer"4953495253484950 exists to mobilize49534954505357

During the 4953505455504949period that followed LYNCH's 4953504856514950, several
addi49535055535055points were made49535054555657reiterated even more strongly his contention that, historically,
once one goes outside high-end science and the group of those who need
access to supercomputers, there is a great de4953505456504955
4953505550505157.  He saw this 495350555253494849535055555056
slowly, with some 49535055575255scientific databases and scholarly 4953505455564948
groups and electronic journals coming on as well as with the availability
of Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) and s49535053535349494953505353524948that

have piqued great popular49535152545157.  For instance, most high school

molecular biology.

Library of Medicine feels 49535156495257that one needs to employ the
identifier field if he or she is to mount a 49535154574856 commercially.  The
problem with a real 49535156545055ed environment is t49535149555456does not know who

uses a Z39.50 server, or what clients are doing with 4953515248574948.  A data

Howard BESSER, School of Library and Information Science, University of
Pittsburgh, spoke primarily about m49535354545257, focusing on 49535355544955and the
broad i4953535653545057them 4953535655514952.  He argu49535450495255
49535357495356 the 4953535754495249d t4953535757575153, which he framed in the form of two questions: 
1) What 49535448515457will one use and what hardware and software will users
have for viewing of the material?  and 2) How can one deliver a
sufficiently robust set of in4953535750564948in an accessible format in a
reasonable amount of time?  Depend49535357565555whethe49535452555057 or CD-ROM is the
medium used, this 49535356564856 raises different issues of storage,
4953545355484949, and t4953545455524949.

Concerni49535449555156esign of 49535448545256s (e.g., sound, gray scale, simple
color, etc.) 49535452485355 various capabilities users may have, BESSER
maintain49535452535055 a layered approach was the way to deal with users'
c4953535753544949.  A result would be that users with less powerful
workstations would simply have less functionality.  He urged members of
the audience to advocate standards and accompanying 49535455525357that handle
495354514952564953544956554951 across a wide variety of4953545351534948.

BESSER also addressed 49535548535556 in 49535548495557design, namely, deciding how
large a machine to design for situ49535453505456hen the largest number of 4953554955514949the lowest level 49535550485257chine, and one desires higher
495354554854495449535453544955then proceeded to the 49535549545357of file size and
its implic49535456565755for 49535551484855ing.  He discussed still images in the main. 
For example, a digital color image that fills the screen of a 49535548534956
mega-pel w4953554956554948 (Sun or Next) will require one megabyte 4953555357554948
for an eight-bit image or three495354545753574953555548514950 for a true49535456535555or
twenty-four4953545554574948.  Lossless 4953555650484949 algorithms (that is,
computational procedures in which no data is lost 49535549525355process of
49535457504857ng [and dec4953545653574948] an image--the exact bit-representation is4953564848524949) might bring s49535549555455down to a third of a 49535551484857pe49535552495455,
but not much further than that.  T4953555452484953size makes it difficult
to fit an appropriately sized set49535556535655se49535555495256on a single disk or to
transmit them quickly enough on a 49535556555255.

one 4953555453524952CD-ROM, which in turn creates a major problem.  One
cannot have4953555750574950, full-4953565550564949s with loss4953565353544954; one
must 49535653575556 them or use a lower resolution.  For 49535656495356-size images,
anything slower than a T-1 speed is impractical49535556525555example, on a
fifty-six-kilobaud line, it takes three minutes to transfer a
one-49535655555257file, if it is not 49535657535456ed; and this speed assumes ideal
circumstances (no other user contending for 49535655575655 bandwidth).  Thus,
49535657575456s of disk access, remote display, and current telephone
connection speed make transmission of 49535653494950484953565256554951

BESSER then discussed ways to deal with these large49535654535656 for 49535654504956
co49535655565457 and de4953565053484951t the user's end.  In this 4953565255514948, the
issues of how much one is willing to lose in the 4953565253574950process and
what image quality one needs in the first place are unknown.  But what is
known is that 4953565456514950entails some loss of data.  BESSER urged that
more studies be conducted on 4953565548554952in different situations, for

viewi4953565554484949d archiving4953575154554948remarked two promising trends for 4953575156484949:  from a technical
perspective, algorithms that use49535750574956 called subjective redundancy
employ principles from visual psycho-physics to identify and remove
information from the image that the human eye cannot perceive; from an
interchange and interoperability 4953575149514951the JPEG (i.e., Joint
Photographic Experts Group, an ISO standard)49535757545249514953575256504949also
offer49535753565455e.  These 49544849494949484954485050525057, BESSER
argued, resembled those raised earlier concerning the design of di49544848545755
platforms.  Gaug49535751555656capabilities of potential users constitutes a
primary goal4954485150494948advocated layering or separati4953575356565549544850575555from

Imagequery, especially the advantages and dis4953575457484949of using

directly to one's data49544856535056olerable situation in the long run on a
networked system.  Finally49544852545756 described a project of Jim Wallace at
the Smithsonian I49544852535355ion, who is mounting 49544852524855in a extremely
rudimentary way on the Compuserv and Genie 49544849574955s and is preparing to
mount them on America On Line.  Although the average user takes over
thirty minutes to download these images (assuming a fairly fast modem),
nevertheless, 49544857515655have been49544850575357ed 25,000 times.49544857495657concluded his talk with49544857545357comments on the business
arrangement between 4954485552574954and 49544854575057.  He contended that not

Edwin 49545751555357, executive director, Memex Research Institute, first
polled the audience in order to seek out regular users of 4954575357574951as
well as those planning to use it some tim49545751524857future.  With nearly
everybody in the room falling into one category or the other, 49545757495357
made a point re49554849495055, namely that numerous individuals, especially those
who use 4955484856514951every day, take4955484949494951their49554851524956to it, the
speeds with 49545757515657y are connected, and how well it all works. 
However, as 4955485156564948discovered between 1987 and 1989 in Australia,
if one wants a4955485350524955rnet but 49554853525255afford it or has some
physical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining 49545756575156it can
be extremely frustrating.  He suggested that because of economics and4954575550574949arriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and have-nots
49554854564956rocess of scholarly communication, even49554855555456United States.

4955484953504949etailed the development of MELVYL in academic year 1980-81 in
the Division of Library Automation at 49545757555355versity of California, in
49554856535657underscore the issue of 4955485251574952system, which at the
outset was 4955485157554948limited.  In short, the project needed to build a
network4955484950504951at time entailed 49554853525055satellite technology, that is,
putting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links
from the State4955485348574952's microwave49554852565755.  The installation of
s49554852495357links, however, did not solve 49554856565555blem (49554854525455ctually
formed part of a larger 49554851555556involving polit49554949505355 financial resources).
For while4955485648494951team could get a signal onto a campus, it had no means
of distributing the signal throughout the campus49554855575755solution involved
adopting a recent 4955495152554950in wireless 4955495254504951 called packet radio,
which combin49554952574955basic not49554952535555packet-switching with radio4955494950555549554951545255
used this4955495150514949 to get 4955485753544949from a point o49554951545157where it
came down, an4955495252554952 for example, in49554954564955libraries, because it
found that wir495549504953564955485657564949especially the older marble buildings,
would cost $2,000-$5,000 per terminal.

BROWNRIGG noted that, ten years ago,4955495755514951had neither the public
policy nor the 4955495154524950hat would have allowed it to use 4955495353534950
in any meaningful way.  Since then much had changed.  He proceeded to
detail research and 4955495648544950of 4955495154524952, how it is being
deployed in 4955505056554948, and what direction he thought i49554953495256take.
The design criteria are to produce a high-speed, one-time, low-cost,
high-quality, secure, license-free device (4955505049554950) that one can
plug in and play today, forget about it, and have access to the Internet. 
By high speed, 4955504948514948meant 1 megabyte and 1.549554953555157s.  Those units
have been built, he continued, and are in 49555050545355cess of being
type-certified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can
be type-49555048545455d by the Federal Communications Commission.  As is the
case with citizens band, one will be able to purchase a unit and not have
to worry about applying for a 49555051575655.

The basic idea, 4955505657534948elaborated, is to take4955505355514949 radio data
transmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic
points4955505255545649555049485156will "gateway" into a medium495550505055554955514950564951(i.e., one that runs at 38.4 kilobytes), s49555054485255perhaps by 1994-1995

to 4955514955574950, and partake of all its services, with no need for an FCC
4955515250525549555057555255 regular bill from the local common carrier.  49555152485657
presented several details of a demonstration project currently taking
place in San Diego and described plans, pending funding, to install a
full-bor495551505249494849555154525255San Francisco area.  This 4955515056484951have 600
nodes running at 49555152494957speeds, and 100 of these nodes 49555154555056libraries,
which in turn 49555155515656the 49555153485655 ports 495551505553554955515257484951 radios that
will give coverag4955515257524948neighborhoods surrounding the l49555148515356.

4955515657534948next explained Part 15.247, a new rule within Title 4749555150485755
Code of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in 1985.49555152485355rule
challenged the industry, which has only now risen49555151565256occasion, to
build a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and
use a fairly exotic method of modulati49555153545355radio wave called spread
spectrum.  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of 49555251505255s so
that numerous data communic49555155495155can occur simultaneously, without
interfering with each other, with49555250505555same wide radio channel49555248505149514955524850564948that the frequencies at which 49555155575657s w49555157495456
are very short wave signals.  They are well above standard microwave and
radar.  With 49555249504856wave that small, 49555249515057becomes a tremendous punch
per bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible.  In
order to minimize the potential for congestion, the project is
undertaking to reimplement software w49555254515157been available in the
49555252525455ing business and is taken for granted now, for example, TCP/IP,
routing algorithms, bridges, and gateways.  In addi4955525050524955
plans to take the WAIS server495552505452494849555254574955public domain and
r4955525152554949it so that one can have a4955525049504951on a Mac instead of a
Unix machine.  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries, in
particular, will want to use 4955525256574953s with packet radio.  This
49555255575655, w49555255555057a team of about twelve people, will run through 1993
and will include the 1004955525356494948 already mentioned as well as other
professionals such as those 49555353494955medical 4955525351494948, engineering, and
law.  Thus, the need is to create an infrastructure of 49555354505055that do not
move around49555256574955, BROWNRIGG hopes, will solve a problem not only for
l49555257505257but for individuals who, by and large today, do not49555351505355ccess
to the Internet from their homes and offices.

Anne KENNEY, associate director, Depart49555549515556P4955545450534950and
Cons49555454535656, Cornell University, opened her talk by observing that the
Cornell Xerox Project (CXP) has been guided by the assumption 49555455485457ability to produc4955554955535049or to replace paper with paper
would be important, at least for the present generation of users and
equipment.  She described three 49555553574857hat 49555556535656ed 4955555655524952
the project:  1) Because49555548485555oject has emphasized th4955554854525549555552555356of
deteriorating brittle books, the quality of what was 49555550575755d had to be
sufficiently high to return a4955555153535549555551555455ment to the shelf.  CXP was
only interested in using:  2) a system that was 4955564950494952, which
meant that it ha49555551495555 cost-competitive with 49555553495155cesses currently
available, principally photocopy and 49555650565557, and 3) new or 495555515350495749555650574856 hardware and software.

KENNEY4955555654514951e a4955565253524948that using4955565250515048offers over
both p4955555356535050:  1) The potential exists to create a higher
49555557564956reproduct49555650485555a 4955564855504952original than conventional
light-lens4955555550524949.  2) 49555650535556a d49555555565055image is an encoded
represent49555655495055it can be 49555555555556ed again and again with no resulting
loss of 49555652485055, as opposed to the situation with 495555574949494949555650564857,
in which there is discernible difference between a second and a
subsequ4955565656554956an image.  3) A495556495149495349555649485355manipulated
in a number of ways to improve 49555557545756pture; for example, Xerox has
developed a windowing application that enables one to capture a page
containing both text and illustrations in a manner that optimizes the
4955565549494954both.  (W49555653495749534955565657484948, one must choose49555749565155to 49555650535656, text or the 4955565151554950; in preservation 49555749575357ing, the
49555750555455 practice is to shoot an4955565257524948ed page twice, once to highlight
the 49555653575357the second time to provide the best c49555655495355for the
4955565549494950.)  44955565753535050also be edited, density levels
adjusted to remove underlining and stains, and to increase legibility for
faint documents.  5) On-screen inspection can take place at the time of
initial setup and adjustments made prior to scanning, factors that
substantially reduce the 4955575256514948retakes required in 49555755525555 control.

A primary goal of CXP has been to evaluate the paper output printed on
the Xerox DocuTech, a high-speed printe49555754495255produces 600-dpi pages from
scanned images at a rate of 13549555657534855a minute.  KENNEY recounted several
publishing challenges to represent faithful and legible repr49555757505656s of
the originals that the 49555750515456copy for the most part successfully
captured.  For example, many of the deteriorating volumes in the project
were heavily 4956484856574950with fine line drawings or halftones or came in
languages such as Japanese, in which the buildup of characters comprised
of varying strokes is difficult to reproduce at lower resolutions; a

Among CXP's findings concerning 49565151515355duction of microfilm from digital

Pamela ANDRE, associate director for automation, National A4956554956504949
Text Digitizing Program (NATDP)4956554849525051 Library (NAL),
presented an o4956555249495649565552485556, which4956555553484948underway at NAL the last
four years, before Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  ANDRE
defined a4956555453514950information as a broad range of material going from
basic and applied research in the hard sciences 49565650575155one-page pamphlets
that are distributed by the cooperative state extension 49565557565355s on such
things as how to grow blueberries.

NATDP began in late 1986 with a meeting of re49565556555055atives from the
land-grant l49565557535455community to deal with the issue of electronic
4956555656574949.  NAL and forty-five of these libraries banded together to
establish this49565653485556--to evaluate 49565649535057ology for converting what
were then source documents in paper form into e49565557485457 form, to provide
acces49565650505755at digit4956565154554952, and then to d49565650564957 it. 
Di49565651495055ing that 495656525349574956565157575549565649575157--the university 4956565052544948as
well as the 49565652535149554956565151494948, potentially down to the county
level--constituted the group's chief concern.

Since January 1988 (when the microcomputer-based scanning system was
installed at NAL), NATDP has done a variety of things, 49565650525455ing which
ZIDAR would 49565653535655 further 4956575048554948For example, the first 4956565553544948
considered 4956574957565549565656515455's discussion phase was49565655535257videodisc, which
indicates how long ago it was conceived.

Over the four years of thi49565748565657, four separate CD-ROM products on
four different agricultural topics were created, two at a
49565656535256-and-OCR station in495656565750495249565750485455wo by 49565749485656bureaus. 
Thus4956565755514950gained comparative 4956575357504949 in term49565656485555ose relative
costs.  Each 4956575454495749565656535157contained the full ASCII text as 49565752524955
page image49565748494955e m49565753534955, or between 4,000 and 6,000 pages of 49565754525156
on these disks.  Topics included aquaculture, food, a49565749555757e and
science (i.e., international 4956565656554953 research), acid rain, and
Agent Orange, which was the final 49565752525355 distributed (approximately
eighteen months before the Workshop).

The third phase of NATDP focused on delivery mechanisms other than
CD-ROM.  At the suggestion of Clifford LYNCH, who was a technical
consultant to 4957484853494949 at this point49574850515756became involved with the
Internet and initiated a 4956575057525649565750545356 help of North Carolina State
University, in49565754535755fourteen 49565757485355land-grant u49565751535757 libraries are

loan requests--a topic for another meeting495657565250564956575554574948the pilot
p49565756504855had been completed for about a year and t49574849535157report would be
available shortly after4957484956554951.  In the meantime, 4957484856554949's
success had led to its extension.  (ANDRE noted that one of the first
things done under the program title was to select a retrieval package to
use with subsequent 49574854535655s; Windows Personal Librarian 4957485552555649565757485355
of choice after a lengthy evaluation.)
  
Three addi49574857534955495748484857564957485150554948planned and were in progress:

     1) An arrangement 49574855495457American Society of Agronomy--a

     about 1908--to scan and create bit-mapped 49574857485156f its journal. 
     ASA granted permission first to put and then to distribute this
     material in electronic form, to hold it at NAL, and to use these
     495748515356494949574950544855as a mechanism to deliver documents or print out4957485349504953for patrons, among other uses.  Effectively, NAL has the

(NATDP)4957495656525052Library (NAL), illustrated the technical
details of NATDP, including her primary responsibility, 49575052495657and
4957505448565749575054495256s on a top49575053524855putting them on CD-ROM.

(ZIDAR remarked a4957505648574955rom the CD-ROM projects, although the
49575054575355ing of the material is nearly identical, in which NATDP is also495750565256494849575050504957and loading it on a Next microcomputer, which in turn
is linked to NAL's integrated library system.  Thus, searches in NAL's
bibliographic4957515149534948will enable people to pull up actual page images
and text for any documents that have been entered.)

In accordance with the session's topic, ZIDAR focused her 4957514948494949
talk on image49575152544956, offering a primer on the three main steps in 4957514851574949:  1) assemble the printed publications; 2) design the 49575150565456

defin49575056545256contents--what will constitute a record, what kinds of
fields will be49575149575456d in terms of author, title, etc.); 3) perform a
certain amount of markup 49575151514955paper4957515057554951.  NAL49575148505656s this
task record by record, 4957515150564948work sheets or some other sort of

Part of this 49575155525556also involves determining NATDP's file and directory
structure:  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 100
images in a 49575152525257, because plac4957515252534952that on a CD-ROM would
reduce the access speed.

This up-front 49575250515556takes 4957515449514952two weeks for a
6,000-7,000-page 49575251575756.  The next step is to 4957525356485549575249545155ge images. 
How long th4957515753564949takes is 49575157554856ed by the decision whether or not
to 49575251574956OCR.  Not 49575252505455ing OCR speeds th49575255495057, whereas text

ha49575252535355 straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page, not
just for the c49575249565755of photographs.

NATDP keys in 49575255545457data, that is, a standard bibliographic49575257505155
including the title49575250495056book and 4957524851494955chapter, which will

Images are scanned from a bound or unbound 4957535050564949, chiefly from
4957525054564955s in the case of NATDP, however, 4957525649554948ten they are
the only copies a495752545248554957525250484951are returned to the shelves.  NATDP
usually scans one record at a time4957535253564948its d495753515150554957525753554948system
tracks the document in that way and does not49575350545256 further logical
separating 4957535057524950s.  After 4957535251564949optical character
recognition, NATDP moves4957525455554949 off the hard disk and maintains a
volume sheet.  Though the system tracks electronically, all the
49575356524855ing steps are also tracked manually with a log49575256555255

ZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when
scanning from paper and microfilm, for example, redoing 49575349575155that need
special handling, setting for dithering or gray scale, and adjust49575348505255
brightness or for the whol49575448525556t one time.

NATDP is s49575350525756at 300 dots per inch, a standard 49575351515157resolution. 
49575353535555adequate for capturing text that is all of a 4957535052554948ize, 300
dpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material 49575352555055very small
text.  Many scanners allow49575354495755fferent image formats, TIFF, of course,
being a de facto 49575354494956.  But if one intends to exchang49575449545557with
other people, the ability to scan other 4957535356574953even if they are
less common, becomes highly desirable.

CCITT Group 4 is the s49575357565456compression for normal black-and-white
images, JPEG for 4957545051544948 or color.   ZIDAR recommended 1) using the
4957535556505048s, particularly 49575448495155attempts to make 49575449575256
available and to allow users to download49575454504956and reuse them from
CD-ROMs; and 2) maintain495753575648554957545050544950output an un49575449525356ed image,
because in49575452525455495754515557574957535752514956s are more likely to be able
to cross platforms.

ZIDAR emphasized the importance of de-skewing and filtering as
requirements on NATDP's upgraded system.  For instance, s49575549485156bound
book4957545350514954books published by the federal government whose pages
are skewed, and trying t49575457525555them straight if OCR is to be performed,
is extremely time-consuming.  The same holds for 4957545354534948of
poor-quality or older 495755524948564957545548534948describe49575457514855 capture from microform, using as an example three
reels from a sixty-seven-reel set of the papers and letters of George
Washington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University.  These
resulted in approximately 3,50049575551574955, which NATDP had had scanned by
its service contractor, Science Applications International Corporation
(SAIC).  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access.  (NATDP did
not have such specialized equipment as a49575550515455ilm scanner.

Unfortunately, the process of 495755545149574957555154524949ilm was not an
unqualified success, ZIDAR reported:  495755575657564957554854544948frame sizes vary,
occasionally some frames were missed, which without spending much time
and money could not be recaptured.

OCR 495755494855495149575557525557 from the 49575554485156images49575556484856frames.  The

also on 49575552575556them could OCR 4957555650524950.

In selecting the 4957564954544948they would use, therefore, 4957565253494948other
factors in mind.  ZIDAR noted two f49575554485255that influenced t4957555648524951
49575556495257s:  1) the inherent 4957555656574953original and 2) the amount of
size reduction on the pages.

The Carver paper49575652555155selected b49575653545355they are informative and visually
interesting, treat a single subject, and are valuable49575653515055ir own right. 
The 49575654495755were s49575654535055and divided into logical records by SAIC, then
delivered, and loaded onto NATDP's system, where bibliographic

completed in summer 1991 and by the end of 49575649515749482 the disk was
scheduled to be published.

Problems encountered during processing included the following:  Because
the 4957565757494948scanning had to be done in a batch, adjustment for
individual page variations was not possible.  The frame size varied on
account49575751525756natur49575751525356 material, and 49575751495257 som49575652544957frames

inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment.  At the time,
computer output4957575453504949was unavailable to test.

The equipment used for a 49575755545157system was the last topic addressed by
ZIDAR49575755555155type of 4957574954514948that one would purchase fo4957575050484950
system 50484848535556:  a micro49575751545356, at least a 386, but preferably a 486;
a large hard disk, 380 megabyte at minimum; a multi-tasking operati4957575248544948that allows one to run some things in batch in the background
while 50484852515157or doing text editing, for example, Unix or OS/2 and,
theoretically, Windows; a high-speed scanner and 4957575748484948oftware that

ZIDAR opined that the 50484848575757one 50484852565556s was more important than the
h50484848554856and might also cost more 4957575748555650484849535357, but it was likely to
prove critical to the success or failure of one's system.  In addition to
a stand-alone 50484857564957workstation for image capture, then, text 50484848545055
requires one or two 50484855555755 stations networked to this 5048495049484948tation

Finally, ZIDAR stressed th5048485456534948ce of buying an open504848535756555048495148484950

Donald WATERS, head of the Systems Office, 5048504955555051,
reported on the progress of a 5048505053484950for a project at Yale to
5048505149555048 di5048505151514951, Project Open Book (POB).  Stating
that POB was in an advanced stage of planning, 50485053574955detailed, in
particular, 50484955555355cess of 5048505057544948a 50485051574955partner and several key
issues under discussion as Yale prepares to move into 50484957575755ject itself. 
He commented first 50485048565055vision that serves as the context of POB and
then described its purpose and scope.

50485048565555sees the library50485051545756future not necessarily as an electronic
50484957515756but as a place that generates, 5048505557555550485056535656improves for its
clients ready access to both intellectual and physical recorded
knowledge.  E50485049574957 tools must find 50485050495556in 5048505149554950in the
con50485052505256this50485052555555.  S50485054494855roles for 504850515749494850485050524855include
serving as:  indirect sources of 504850505348494950485051565057 or as "finding"
aids (the on-line catalogues, the article-level indices, registers for
50485152495157 and archives); di5048505256514954504850545548565048505257574948; full-text
images; and various kinds of compound5048505348565148 (the
so-called50485053485649485048505450574948of Hypertext, mixed text and image,
mixed-text image format, and multimedia).

POB is looking 5048515355544948ly a5048505452505550485056545655n image 50485151555255, the uses to
which50485054555356will be put (e.g., storage, printing, browsing, and then use
as input for other processes), OCR as a subsequent50485055555756 to image
capture, or creating5048505756574957and also possibly 50485155514955ing
microfilm.

While50485148484855will come from a variety of 50485153574955, 50485150515455considering
especially input from 50485157525455ation mi50485148545356  A50485149494856e outcome is that
the film and paper which provide the 5048515153484948the i5048515256534950
eventually may go off into remote 50485153495657and that 5048514956514955 may
be the primary ac50485153515255ol.

The purpose and scope of POB focus on imaging.  Though related to CXP,
POB has two features which distinguish it:  1) scale--conversion of
10,000 volumes into digital5048524950554949; and 2) source5048515250494951from5048515657574949  Given these 50485153524856, several key working hypotheses guide
POB, including:  1) Since 50485251555055using 50485249495657, it is not concerned with
the 5048515750564952as a 5048524951574952edium.  2) D5048515648574950ry can improve
a50485248515256 recorded knowledge through 50485253565256 and network distribution at
a modest incremental cost of 50485252515449503) Captur50485155575156storing documents
in a 5048524956484956 is necessary to further 50485157574855ments in50485252535755.
(POB 5048525155564949es between the50485252565456, digitizing 50485257555056and OCR,
which at this stage it does not plan to perform.)

Currently in its first or organizational phase, POB fou50485256554856it could
use a vendor selection 50485249565456to facilitate a good deal of the
5048524956494953work (e.g., creating a project team and advisory board,
confirming the validity of the plan, establish5048525050485650485254575456the project
and a budget, selecti50485251495455materials to convert, and then rais50485252484955
5048525557564948funds).

POB developed numerous s50485254515157criteria5048535052554952a firm committed
to image-50485348515156 management, the ability to serve as systems integrator
in a large-scale50485256504857over several years, interest in5048525457565650485255525256requisite software as a standard rather than a custom product, and a
willingness to invest substantial resources in 5048534855484949 itself.

Two50485351485455s, DEC and Xerox, were selected as finalists in October 1991,
and with the suppor50485350575557Commission on Preservation and Access, each
was commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the
5048535451505650485352575057to submit a formal proposal 50485257545255 completion of the
50485355555155, which included a50485355494955 and costs. The terms were that POB would
pay the loser.  The results for Yale of involving a 5048544950495550485349565756: 
broad50485349505055ement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low
cost50485351545356may have long-term significance in carrying out t5048545050574949(twenty-five to thirty university people are engaged in POB); better
understanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets
for imaging 50485449555755s; a competitive50485356575357; and a more sophisticated
view504854495149565048535350535650485353535055.

the clear winner.  WATERS then described the components 5048545757555550485456535356,
the design principles, and some5048545050524948sts estima504854494955565048544953524949.

C5048544854544948are essentially four:  a conversion subsystem, a
network-accessible storage 50485448574857 for 10,000 books (and POB expects
200 to 600 dpi50485449555256), browsing stations distributed on the campus50485451484956, and 50485451505555 access to the image printers.

Among 5048545354545051POB wanted 5048545349514949at the highest

at $1 million over the three phases.  At the end of the project, the annual
operating costs 50485551524957 primarily for the software and hardware 50485553545556
come to about $60,000, but these exclude costs for labor needed in the

Finally, the select5048555353504949 produc50485557525255Yale a more sophisticated
view50485557565056imaging markets:  the 5048555454544948 of complex5048565457514949in

George THOMA, chief, Communications Engineering Branch, National Library
of Medicine (NLM), i50495255545256ed several of the 5049525648544951discussed by
the previous speakers.  He introduced the topic of special 50495351495155s by
not50495350495655 advantages of electronic imaging.  For example, it is regenerable
because it is a coded file, and real-time50495349564857control is possible with
e5049525549544948capture, whereas in photograph504952545450494850495255564955not.

One 50495257555656ifficulti5049534848484951in the 5049535349525057was
image 50495353515256which, without belabor50495348565156obvious, means di50495354495355
things for maps, medical X-rays, or broadcast television.  In the case of
documents, THOMA said5049535455505650495356545456boils down to legibility of the
textual parts, and fide504953575749494850495348565057 gray or color photo print-type
material.  L50495349505549485049534954544952scan density, the standard in most
cases being 300 dpi.  Increas50495355565156resolution with scanners that
perform 600 or 1200 dpi, however, comes at a cost.

Better5049535351484953entails at least four5049535548524948 kinds of costs:  1)
equipment costs, 50495448545756the CCD (i.e., charge-couple device) with
greater number of elements costs more;  2) time costs that translate to
the actual 504954504954565049535356544953manual labor is involved (the time is
also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
machine i5049545253504953or network5049535653515550495356484955504954485448565049545352514952s
well as the storage);  3) media cost5049544852524949at high 5049545053484948s larger
files have50495356575255stored; and 4) transmission5049545050494957re is just
5049544851564948to be 50495356525755tted.

But while 5049545349554949takes care of the issue of 5049545557514949in image
50495456534955, other deficiencie5049544857544948do with contrast and 50495453485357on the
page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified.  Thus,
THOMA proceeded to illustrate various d5049545051494949, how they are
manifested, and several techniques to overcome them.

Fixed thresholding w50495454565255first t50495450515456 described, suitable for
black-and-white text, when the 50495453535557does not vary over the page.  One
can have many 504955515255494850495452545257 levels in 50495548555657504955485552555049545455544953offered an example of extremely poor c50495456545455, which resulted from
the 504955515256494850495550515355ck was a heavy red.  This i50495551485355ort of 5049554848514948
when microfilmed fails to provide any 5049555049534949whatsoever.  Fixed
th5049545756544949is the way to change the black-to-red 50495551494957to the
desired 50495454555457white 50495551565656.

Other 50495457555155s included material that had been browned or yellowed by
age.  This was also a case of 504955505751494850495554535656y, and correction was
done by fi5049555257534954.  A final 50495551495456boils down50495548575355 same
thing, slight variability, but it is not significant.504955505752555049555550534951
solves this problem as well.  The m50495552544956 equivalent is certainly legible,
50495549525455comes with dark areas.  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
5049555049504948in this case, he did show the reproduced electronic image.

When one has variable 50495649515657over a page or the lighting 5049564957514951
area varies, especially in the case where a bound volume has light
shining on it, the image must be processed by a dynamic5049555557534953cheme.  One scheme, 50495552515556averaging, allows the 5049565353514953 not to
be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
characteristics.  Th5049555355494948s of a pixel determine where 5049555551504951
should be set for that pixel.

THOMA showed an50495652505757of a page 5049565449534952made 50495653554956t by a
variety of techniques, including a burn mark, coffee stains, and a yellow
marker.  Application of a fixed-504956555550495050495650505357THOMA argued, might
take care of several de50495657515655ies on 50495653495156 but not all50495654575255m. 
Performing the calculation for 5049565350544957 setting, however,
removes most of the5049564951504952so that at least the text is 50495748534955.

Another50495749525257is representing a gray level with black-and-white pixels
by a 50495657485155 known as dithering or e5049574953574948screening.  But 50495650495757
does not provide good50495748575255quality for pure 5049565156494954textual
material.  THOMA illustrated this point with 50495657545655s. Although its
suitabil50495652525557hotoprint is the reason for 5049565448495048 or
d50495654534956, it cannot be us5049575155484951compound image.  In the document
that was distributed by CXP50495749555256noticed that the dithered image of the
IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in50495749534957.  He presented an

Carl 5050485249544950, coordinator, American Memory, Library of Congress,

Patricia BATTIN, president, the Commission on 5050575654484951and Access
(CPA), addressed the 5051485054575250.  She
listed several areas where the library profession 50514848495156analog world of
the printed book had made enormous contributions over the past hundred
years--for example, in bibliographic formats, binding 50514855495457, and, most
important, in determining what constitutes longevity or 50514854495557quality.

Although5051485454534949have lightene505148535452555051485648514950burden through the
development of nation50514854494955intern50505756485556collaborative programs,
nevertheless, a pervasive mistrust of other people's 5051485356554948remains a
major obstacle to successful coop50514856535655, BATTIN said.

The zeal to achieve perfection, regardless of the cost, has hindered
rather than facilitated access in some instances, and in the digital
environment, where no real 5051494854574948exist, has brought an ironically
just reward.

50514852485555argued that 5051495050494948are a double-edged sword for those concerned
with505148555750495650514853525055human record, that is, the provision of
50514853565455to recorded knowledge in a multitude of media as far into the
future as possible.  S5051485450534951essential to 5051485651534948
interconnectivity and access, but5051494850514951, as LYNCH pointed out
yesterday, if set too soon they can hinder creativity, expans50514856515555capability, and the broadening of access.  The characteristics of
5051495448484948for 50514950515755 imagery differ radically from50514949545255for analog
imagery.  A50514856535655nature of 50514856505456technology implies continuing
volatility and change.  To reiterate, precipitou5051495556564948-setting can
inhibit 5051494954574950but delayed s5051485752544954results in chaos.

Since in BATTIN'S opinion the near-term prognosis for reliable archival
50515049494957, as defined by librarians 50514957565055analog world, is poor, two
alternatives remain:  standing pat 50514957525757old t50514952554957, or
reconceptualizing.

P505150485248495050515048555755s for electronic50515048484855fall50515048485755wo general domains. 
One is the 5051495457524948 assurance 50514956575257 to 5051504957564948originally
generated, stored, disseminated, and used in 5051495257524949form.  This
domain contains several subdivisions, including 1) the closed,
proprietary systems discussed the previous day, bundled information such
as 5051495649564949journals and government agency records, and 5051495750554948ally
produced or captured raw data; and 2) the application 5051505257544948
50515053485457ies to the reformatting of materials 5051504855534948 published on a
deteriorating analog medium such as acid paper or videotape.

The pre5051505157504948of 5051505248504955requires a reco5051505348524951 of our
pr5051505351484949principles during a volatile, 50515057505356less transition which
may last far longer than any of us envision today.  BATTIN urged the
necessity of shifting focus from assessing, measuring, and setting5051514857554948 for the permanence of the 505150525156555051505351505550515148544855 of managing
5051514848494950505150575755575051505648504951tored on a variety of media and
requir505150534857555051505050564948ever-changing hardware and software for access--a
fundamental shift50515052565657library profession.

50515054515755offered a primer on how to move forward with reasonable confidence
in a world without 50515055525157.  Her comments fell roughly into two sections:
1) 5051505654524948in the real world 5051515155494949politics of reproduction.

In regard to real-world 50515148525157, 50515149525555argu50515154565355need to redefine the
5051514857534949archive and to begin to think in terms of life cycles.  In
the past, the naive assumption that paper would last forever produced a
cavalier attitude toward 5051505656484952The transient nature of the
5051515651494955has compelled people to recognize and accept upfront 50515149545049535051514951494949 in place of 50515155544957y.

Digital s50515156505057have to be developed and set in a cooperative context
to ensure efficient exchange of 5051515750524949.  Moreover, during this
transition period, greater flexibility concerning how 50515249524955s such as
backup copies and archival 5051514956495550515156555255CXP are defined is necessary,
50515249515755opportunity 5051524950574956ll be lost.

In 5051515656505750515153544957on, particularly in the university setting50515248565456
also5051524949545048avoid going off in a hundred different
directions50515248514855CPA has catalyzed a small group of 50515153565457ies called
the La Guardia Eight--because5051515350504950Airport is where meetings take
place--Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Princeton, Penn State, Tennessee,
Stanford, and USC, to 50515250574855 a digital preservation consortium to look
at all these issu5051525051495550515155554856de facto 5051525257544948as we move along,
instead of waiting for something that is officially blessed.  Continuing
to apply analog val5051515756484948finitions of 5051525556504948to the 50515249495155
environment50515252545356 said, will effectively lead to forfeiture of the
benefits of 50515250575056technology to research and scholarship.

Under the second rubric, the politics of reproduction, 50515250515555reiterated
an oft-made argument5051534949484950the electronic library, namely, that it
is more difficult to transform than to create, and nowhere is that belief
expressed more dramatically than 50515351535455conversion of brittle books to
new media.  Preserving information published in 5051525356494949media involves
making sure the 5051525254504950remains accessible and that 505152575657565051525353564950is not lost through5051525657524951.  In the 50515349545055world of
photocopies and microfilm, the issue of fidelity to the original becomes
paramount, as do 50515353495055of "Whose 50515254565156?" and 5051525453505550515255494956?"

50515352485355elaborated5051535453535550515350535056s with a few examples from a recent study
conducted by the CPA on the problems of 50515356565555ing text and image. 
Discussions with 50515354504956, librarians, and curators in a variety of
disciplines dependent on t5051534848494951 generated 505152575555495050515355524856s,
for50515349555656:  1) Copy what is, not what the 5051535756554949is capable of. 
This is very important for the history of ideas.  S50515449494955 wish to know

workstation the opportun50515355555155erase all the defects and enhance the
presentation.  2) Th5051535652544948 of 5051544849574950--50515353535655 good enough, what
can we afford, and the difference it makes--5051544853554948subjective versus
ob50515351555256resolution.  3) The 5051535254544948s between primary and secondary
users.  Restricting the definition of primary user50515451575657ne in whose5051544951564949 the material has been published runs one headlong into the
reality t50515449565255se printed books have had a host of other users50515453535655
50515354555049525051545252574949, who not only were looking for very 50515448575456t
things, but who also shared values 5051535648504952 from those of the
pr5051544857554948.  4) The relationship50515356535255 standard 5051545250554953 to new

BARONAS explained that TIFF was not5051575551554948 in collaboration with or

505248484848555550515752495055introduced the final topic, 5051575251504953, by noting that it is
becoming an increasingly important part of the imaging business.  Many

and more character data as 5051575452534949ir 50515754535656system.  Re the issue of
OCR versus rekeying, 50524848515455posed se5052484854514953:  How does one get
text into computer-readable form?  D50515755485656use automated processes? 
50515755514857attempt to eliminate the use of operators where possible? 
S50524856485155s for accuracy, he said, are extremel5052485053574949:  it makes a
major difference in cost and time whether one sets as a s50524848495255 98.5
percent acceptance or 99.5 percent.  He mentioned outsourcing as a
possibility for converting text.  Finally, what one does with 50524854565256e
to prepare it for the recognition50524852545556 is also50524856505149485052485249564948

This question also contained a trick to test 50525449514857 of serendipity.

Th5052545550564949using the 5052545250574948 systems started off worse 50525451524856 ones
using print, but by the third50525451535756three sessions in the series had
caught up to print.  As one might expect, 5052545553544949 provide a much
50525457485355means of 50525551535156what one wants to read; reading speeds, once the

Almost none 5052545349535650525552525456could 50525550525355 the hard task--the analogous

Th50525456515455text5052554857495650525455565655is driven by text offers the explanation.
Everything is focused on 50525548484956; to see the pictures, one must press
on an icon.  Many 50525554555757found the right article contain50525555525556answer

LESK concluded by commenting that, on one hand, 5052564953504955was easy
to use.  On the other 5052555350554948text display system, which represented
twenty man-years of work in programming and polishing, was not winning,

To Ricky ERWAY, associate coordinator, American Memory, Library of

simultaneously 5052575448514949 perhaps t505256574950565052575149495057

collections that need to be converted.  ERWAY limited her remarks to the
process5052574952484948ting text to machine-readable form, and the 5052575053534948
LC's text 5052574853514949, for example, bound volumes, microfilm, and
handwritten manuscripts.

Two ass50534848535057have guided 5053484856494951, ERWAY said:  1) A desire not
to perform5052575451555650525756525256inhouse.  Because of 5052575150564952 formats and
types of texts, to capitalize the equipment and have the talents and
skills to operate them at LC would be extremely expensive.  Further, the
natural inclination to upgrade to newer and better e50525752555557each year
made it reasona50525756525355 AM to focus on what it did best and seek external5053485351524950services.  Using 50525752535155 bureaus also allowed AM to have
several 50525756525657operations take place at the same time.  2) AM 50534852524956a
technology 50534854485455, but an effort to improve access to library5053485257494950.  Hence, whether text was 50534853515557 using OCR or rekeying
mattered little to AM.  What 50525755525157were co50534848545755accuracy of results.

AM considered different 505348525250575053484953524955nd selected three to
p5053485448545550534849575556small tests in order to acquire a sens50534854555457field. 
The sample5053485751484950 with which they worked included 5053485754504949
correspondence, type5053494851484957 from the 1940s, and

requirements for the three 5053485754554954it had engaged.  For instance,

volumes or anything that could not be sheet-fed also constituted a factor
eliminating companies that would have5053485552564948 OCR.

means one or two50534856504856per page.  The initial batch of test50534950535055s

As AM began converting whol5053495748484951, it 50534953535056 the 5053495457564949 for

to begin50534957534856ing work more than50534957505055years ago before LC5053494957484951
for SGML applications had been established.  Since AM's goal was simply
to retain any50535050555455 intellectual content represented by the formatting
50534950575655document (which would be lost if one 5053504952504948a straight ASCII
conversion), AM used "SGML-like" codes.  These codes resembled SGML tags
but were used without the benefit of 50534953575456-type definitions.  AM found
that many 5053504956484954were not yet SGML-proficient.

Additional factors influencing the approach AM took with respect to
coding included:  1)50535048505055ability of any known microcomputer-based
user-retrieval software to take advantage of SGML coding; and 2) the
multiple inconsistencies in format50535051505656older 50535050574856s, which
confirmed AM in its desire not to attempt to force the different formats
to conform to a single 5053505153565052 (DTD) and thus create the
need for a separate DTD for each 50535054565256. 

The five text5053514856514950 that AM has converted or is in the process of50535055565455ti5053505351484948 a 5053504953504948 of eighteenth-century broadsides, a

ERWAY next reviewed the results of AM's experience 50535057535555keying, noting
again that because the bulk 50535051565056materials are historical, the quality50535152555456text often does not lend itself to OCR.  While non-English
speakers are less likely to guess or elaborate or correct typo50535057525256
original text, they are also less able to infer what we would; they also
are nearly incapable of 5053514951574949handwritten text.  Another
dis5053515356574951working with overseas keyers is that 50535056535657much less
5053505754534948telephon50535149564855ques50535150574855especially on the coding, with the
result5053505656534949develop their own rules as they encounter new
situations.

Govern50535153525755ntracting procedures and time frames posed a major challenge
to performing the conversion.  Many service bureaus are not accustomed to
retaini50535148555255image, even if they 5053514951545550535154555555Thus, 50535151555557 of image
format and storage media were somewhat novel to many of them.  ERWAY also
remarked other problems in deali505351554850565053515249554953, for example,
their inability to 50535152515456text 5053515353524948 from the kind of microfilm
that LC uses for preservation purposes.

But 50535251485655 control, in ERWAY5053525254544951, was the most time-consuming
aspect of5053515753574951ou5053515448514950.  AM has been attempting 5053515757564948
a 10-percent 50535154515656review, looking at either every tenth document or
5053515355484950page to make certain505352525549575053525050485049main50535250495355

requirement for 50535155545256, finding errors produces a desire to correct
them and, in turn, to clean up the whole collection, which defeats the
50535251505655 to some extent.  Even a double entry requires a
character-by-c50535157485356 comparison to the original to meet the 505352505348565053525050484950.  LC is5053525754554956 publish imperfect texts, which
makes a5053525448534951deal50535252495257 industry standard an emotionally
fraught issue for AM.  As was mentioned in the previous day's discussion,
going from 99.95 to 99.995053525553544955 usually50535253545255s costs and
means a third keying or another complete run-through of the text.

Although 50535349554855learned much from it5053535149484950s with various 5053525750544948s
and 505352515756565053534956554953, ERWAY concluded pessimistically that no
break505352544953565053535254544948chieved.   Incremental improvements have occurred
in some 50535255535655OCR technology, 5053525355534950processes, and 5053525450564949
50535349485156s acceptances50535352485155, though they may lead to somewhat lower costs,
do not offer much encouragement to many people who are anxiously awaiting
the day that the entire contents of LC are available on-line.

the question of 5053535555545155 con50535355565555:  1)
Text in an image can be read by a human but not by a computer, so of
course it is not searchable and there 50535353514855much one can do with it.  2)
Some material simply requires word-level access.  For instance, the legal
profession insists on 5053535748504948access to its 50535355555256; with taxonomic or

something that cannot be achieved 5053545151534950with today's technology. 
4) Text stored as ASCII and delivered in ASCII is standardized and highly
portable.  5) People just want 50535454534849485053545049574948 even those who do not
know how to do it.  NAL, for the most part, is 5053555048484953at an
actual cost per average-size page of approximately $7.  NAL scans the
page to create the electronic image and passes it through the OCR device.

ZIDAR next rehearse5053555054534948typical problems encountered during editing. 
Praising the celerity of her student workers, ZIDAR observed that 50535452564955

HOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several
comments about mo5053575056545052one reaches the point of
p5053575153484951.  For example, in regard to an application containing a
significant amount of redundant data, such as form-type5053565757575550535756495256
companies today are working on various kinds of form renewal, prior to
going through a recognition process, by using dropout colors.  Thus,
acquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth
considering.  50535755485755also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks
one's imaging system.  It is extremely important, 5053575152534948costly in
terms of either capital investment or service, and determin50535757545555quality

the other hand, the service bureaus know their job and 50544950545155 it

As a useful comparison, ERWAY5054495248494948AM's costs as follows:  $0.75
cents to $0.85 cents per thousand 50544955485357s, with an average page
containing 2,700 5054485457504948.  Requirements for coding and imaging
increase the costs.  Thus, con5054495349515550544950555749525054495551524948the coding,

HOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the 505450515655494850545053575555
50545053495555d (substantial in her experience) to genera50545055575555kind of
structured 50545148515155necessary for manipulating the text 50545053514955computer or
loading it into any retrieval system.  She wondered if the speakers could
extend the 505451495155565054505448564948about the cost-benefit of adding or exerting
5054505448574955.  ERWAY noted that several OCR 50545057555056retain italics,
bold50545153495557other spatial 5054515052574948.  While5054515356574952may not be in
the format desired, these 50545150495656possess the ability to remove the
original materials quickly from the hands of the people 5054515451555550545149495055
conversion, as well as to retain that information so that users can work
with it.  50545152555356ejoin50545149495056the current thinking on 50545152495255is that one
should not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that
way.  To be sure, one needs to know5054514850514954was italicized, but
how can one get from one to the other?  One can map 5054515157555750545156555557 to
the typographic representation.

FLEISCHHAUER suggested that, given the 100 million items the Library
holds, it 5054515555544949possible for LC to do more than report that a thing
was i50545157564857 as opposed to 505451535755555054515352564948s, although that may be
desirable in some contexts.  Promising to talk a bit dur50545252545156afternoon

high degree of reli50545254484855, at least as good as OCR.  STEVENS drew a
useful distinction between standard, generalized50545253555556(i.e., defining

not just for referencing or to help locate an ite50545450485055is 50545355495155ed, but also to put 50545355565756ags in

Stuart WEIBEL, senior research scientist, Online C50545652555055 Library Center,
Inc. (OCLC), described 5054565248545252.  He
argued that the 5054565255544949world into which we are moving must
accommodate not only the future but the past as well, and to some degree
even the present.  Thus, starting out 50545748545455end with 5054565649484953 and5054565651534956one would like to move toward much 5054565750524957
5054565752514956.

For example, 5054565756534951 had to do with 50545748555155ically converting
document images into a structured 50545650545757database with OCR text as
indexing and also a little bit of 50545652515057 formatting and tagging of
that text.  Th50545751555155project hosted by Cornell University, Bellcore,
OCLC, the American Chemical Society, and 50545652555057Abstracts, constitutes
WEIBEL's principal concern at the moment.  This50545654575657is an 50545657525655 of
5054565750494948 text for which one already has a machine-readable 50545750485056into
a50545657525355 more suitable for 5054575348524949delivery and 50545749495457searching. 
(Since Michael LESK had previously 5054575548504948CORE, WEIBEL50545752535155say
5054575052545550545748525755ing it.)  Borrowing a c50545749565056phrase, de novo synthesis,50545749575555 cited the 50545757565655Journal of Current Clinical Trials as 5054575054544948
of de novo 5055484852504949publishing, that is, a form in50554848545055the primary
form of the information is 5054575154574948.

5054575748554951, then, which OCLC completed a couple of years ago and in
fact is about to resume, is a model5054575148484948one takes page50554849484856either

505457565055495050554850535555, either on-line or local50554850495555operating assumption
is that accepting some blemishes in the data, especially for
retroconversion of materials, will make it possible to accomplish more. 
Not enough money is available to support perfect 5054575449514948.

50554850545055related several steps taken to perform image preprocessing
(5054575356564948 on the image before performing optical character
recognition), as well as 50545755545255ost5054575555564948.  He deni50554853505555existence
of intelligent 50545756495757 re50545756514957 and asserted that what is wanted is
page 505457575155494950554853525556is a long way off.  OCLC has experimented with
merging of multiple o50554849515149545055484852574951system50554852575755will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 55055485148514948s out of every
l,000 to a505548485549505125055484857545052 l,000, but it
is not good50554854575155.  It will never be50554855485756.

Concerning the CORE 50554950514955, 50554855545455observe50554853525555Bellcore is tak50554850514855

buil5055485154554951into a Newton 5055495253564948the same system that underlies
the o5055495350575550554852515755in virtually all of the reference products at OCLC. 
The long-term goal is to make the s50554949484855interoperable so that not just
50554857504856's 50554855505555and OCLC5055485356534948can access this data, but other
50554951495256can as well, and the key to that is the Z39.50 common command
language 50554855525256full-text extension.  50554855555455is fine for MARC records,
but is not enough to do it for full text (50554857515655, make 50554856514957s
5055494950574951).

50554953505655next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes,
for example, as noted by HOCKEY, in the world of extremely large
50554953574956s, using highly structured data to perform field searches. 
50554957525055argu50554957535056by build50555048495756505549495353575055495551575650554956525755 (i.e., the
s5055494954495049originally on a printed page), it becomes easy to
look at a journal article even if one cannot rea50554954485755haracters and know
where the title or author is, or what the sections of that document would be.
OCLC wants 5055505048544948at 5055495452534948explicit 505549564953555055505249574948because it will
be important for retrieval 50554957555756.

The second big advantage 50555048555456is that it gives one the ability to
build5055495755534949into th5055495548494948 that can be used for display 50555050545356
without contaminati50555049525755data with instructions about how to format
things.  The distinction lies between procedural markup, which tells one50555050485456o put dots on the page, and descriptive5055495653544953describes
the elements of a 505550515054565055505651484948believes that there should be no50555048535449565055505248534950 at
all, th50555053514955data 5055495757494948completely unsullied by information about
italics or boldness.  That s50555049525757left up 5055505348545650555052565155device,
whether505550555749555055504857504951 is a page printer or a screen 5055504956504952. 
By keeping one's 50555055514857free50555057575057kind of 5055505551554949on, one can
make decisions down the road, for example, reorganize the data in ways
that are not cramped by built-in not50555150565756what 5055505554494948italic and
wh5055505454574951bold.  50555056554955strongly advocated 5055505757574956.  As
an 50555053565657he illustrated the index5055515153564951 the CORE data.  With

complaint that 50555154525556hard to read in its native form, although markup
decreases considerably once one gets 50555155555757body50555056555055out the 50555154535755
however, one would not have the 505551484956495550555148504855One can pass
markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
printed version of the d5055515657574955nex5055515055544952an extremely cluttered 50555155514956ump of OCLC's
system, in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
the screen.  (He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
X-Windows as a result50555151535356progress of 50555155574957Project.)50555157505757also
5055515657554954two major parts 50555153504955interface:  l) a control box that
allows one to generate lists of items, which resembles a small table of
contents based on key words one wishes to search, and 2) a 50555156535756
viewer, which is a separate 50555248485155 in and of itself.  He demonstrated
how to follow links t50555249525455the electronic database simply by selecting
the appropriate button and bringing them up.  He also50555249484956roblems that
remain to be accommodated 5055525256515550555248524957 (e.g., as pointed out by LESK,
what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure).

Given the constraints of time, 50555254525155omitted a large number of ancillary
items5055525455484952ay a few50555251514855concerning storage requirements and
what will be 50555157494855d to put a lot of things on line.  Since it is
5055525755574948expensive to reconvert all of this data, especially if it is
just in paper form (and even 50555248555156 in 5055525450564949form in typesetting
tapes), he advocated building journals5055525554554949ally from the start.  In
that case, if one only has text graphics and indexing (5055534852504948ll that
one needs with de novo5055534851484950publishing, because there is no need to
go back and look at bit-maps of pages), one can get 10,0005055525448574948of
full text, or almost 6 million pages per year.  These pages can be put in
approximately 135 gigabytes of 505553494854555055535357534949not 50555255555656 much,
50555350545655said.  For twenty years, something less than three ter50555254564855would
5055535057554949.  50555352525255calculated the cost50555255565157ing this information as
follows:  If a50555256565457505552555250555055525752484952$1,000, then a50555256545457 costs5055534850564953$150555349485557to buy in terms of hardware.  One also needs a
b5055535349505650555355515555it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that 5055534856554949. 
So, to support a 50555350504856, multiply by five50555351544856gives $5 50555352565257er
year for a supported t50555350505356of data.

Prior to speaking about SGML and markup, Michael 5055565553494954, editor,
Text E50555654574856Initiative (TEI), University of Illinois-Chicago, first drew
a distinction between texts and computers:  Texts are abstract cultural
and linguistic objects while c50555557514856 are complicated physical devices,
he said.  A5055564849545650555648484856cannot be placed inside5055564851504955; with
5055564857564948one can only 5055574948574953and act upon those5055564855484948ations.

The recognition that all5055564950554953 is e50555653485155, 5055565354504954
argued, leads to the 5055565051534950of two things:  1) The topic description
for this sess50555651514855slightly misleading, because the50555748495555be no discussion
of pro50555655555156ns50555749515356-50555657485255unless50555749544957 means is 5055565157504954
working with text with 50555657534857.  2) No text 5055565351515550555656484857ed in a50555656535457 without some sort of 50555655575656; images are one way of 50555656545056 text,
ASCII is another, SGML yet50555653515656.  There is no 505556544856575055565456504950
information loss, that is, th5055565453554948perfect reproduction of 50555755544855that
allows one to do away with the original.  Thus, the question becomes,
What is the most useful505557515755495450555750485555 for a serious work?
This depends on what kind of 5055565653514950 one is talking about50555754505555projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex5055575054534951and fair5055565754544948 manipul5055574954494948he textual material.
In order to use that 50564849515449505055575254564949, one has to calculate it
slowly or manually and store the result.  It needs to be stored, therefore,
as part of one's 50555753545549575055575154545550555754545257one 5055575055505750555751495057

5055575155544948somehow to control the 50555755495255ity of the re5055575751504954a text;
that means 5055575353504948a 50564850564955finding out whether a document and an
electronic505557535348504950555753484957is legal or not; and that
5055575450554956grammar of 50555754505656s.

implicit and explicit, as applied to text,50555755575755eir capabilities.  He
argued that these 50555755565356 correspond to different model50564849565157 that
5055575555494948developers have.  For example, one 50555757555057model5056485452524950
is that there is no internal 50564852555657, but just one thing after another,

In this situation of increasingly 5056495650494951extual information and the
need to control that complexity in a useful way (which begs the question
of the need for good5056495149565750565050525156), one has the introduct50564952505755SGML. 
With SGML, one can develop specific document-type declarations
for 50564951535657text types or, as with the TEI, a5056495649514949generate
general d505649534854505350564955485655an 50565052575655all sorts 50565051565555.
The TEI is an a505650495154494850564954555756formats for text 5056504849514952 that
will ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier.
It offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological
revolution.

It has been a continuing challenge50564956484956TEI to create 5056504956525650565050565257
that do some work in 50565052515555ling the50565052544849505056505250545550565053525056object but
also allowing one 5056505556514955real text that one will find. 
Fundamental to the not5056505556555550565049505556is that TEI conformance allows one

meet the needs of research, because t50565156495155came out5056515554505650565056514956
community, which did not feel adequately served by existing 50565155494855s. 
The 50565155524956must be extensive as well as compatible with5056514848524948and
emerging standards.  In 1990, version 1.050565248525056G50565155545357 was released
(5056515753574955illustrated their contents)5056524853525049oted th50565249505755problem besetting electronic text has

e505651535350565056515149534953s.  505652514854565056525054494948 as currently formulated
contain few fixed requirements, but one of them is this:  There must
always be a 50565153505556 header, an in-file SGML tag that 50565249565755s
1) a bibliographic description 505652485653555056515555534949object one is talking
about (that is, who included it, when, what for, and under50565250535355title);
and 2) the copy text from which it was derived, if any.  If there was
no5056515456524949or if 5056515550524952is unknown, then one states as much.

for its endorsement this coming winter5056525350484949itself exists to 50565252485155
a markup language, not a marked-up text.

Among the challenges the TEI has attempted to face is the need for a
5056524951524953 that will work for 50565349564957projects, 50565254545257handle the
level of 50565250575055that people are using now to tag only chapter, section,
and paragraph divisions and not much else.  At the same time, such a
50565252525057also will be able to scale up gracefully to 5056525257514948 highly
detailed 50565255495455which many50565253525656foresee as the future destination of
much el50565351505057text, and 50565350505655s not 5056525257525051but the
50565348575055 home of numerous5056525354554954s in specialized areas.

SPERBERG-McQUEEN dismissed the lowest-common-denominator approach as
un50565257485657upport the kind of applications that draw 50565349534855who have
never been in the public library regularly before, and make them come
back.  He advocated more interesting text and m50565255574956lligent text. 
Asserting that it is not beyond economic feasibilit50565351575455ve good texts,
5056535050494955noted that 50565357545656Guidelines listing 200-odd tags
contains tags that one is expec50565357514955enter every time the relevant
textual feature occurs.  It 50565349505057all the 505653495256494850565357574855need now,
and 50565351525349485056535049514948hat everyone will tag things in 50565448524857way.

The question of ho50565354565649485056535051494948e text is in large part a function
of their reaction to what 5056535755554955termed the issue of
reproduc50565355515255.  W50565354525456needs to 505654515553494950565351554856e are the things
one wants to work with.  Perhaps a more useful concept than505653565549555056535354514955 or recoverability is 50565352575555 process50565352575155, that is,
what can one get from an 5056545353574953 without reading it again
50565452525255original.  He illustrated this contention with a page from
Jan Comenius's bilingual Introduc50565448555456Latin.

5056545256504955returned at length to 5056544953514950 images as simulacra
for50565451494857, in order to reiterate his belief50565455555055n the long run more
than 50565357495255of p50565356515556particular editions of 50565453525157are needed,
because just as second-generation photocopies and 5056535755514955
microfilm de50565448495455e, so 5056544854484956representations tend to
5056544855544950and one tends to overstress some relatively trivial aspects
o5056545150504949such as its layout on the page, which 50565549575555always

English and Latin versi505654555653555056554852515049text, for example. 
Moreover, in many crucial respects it is easy to fool oneself concerning
what a scanned image5056554855484951will accomplish.  F50565454515049485056555053534948

Further, even the high-quality materials being produced at Cornell use
much 505655544851555056555052544950that one would need if studying those books as
physical objects.  It is a choice that has been made5056545656544948n arguably

The TEI comes from the research community, where its first allegiance
lies, but it is not just an academic exercise.  It has relevance far

5056565554565552
Dur50565754495155 discussion that followed, several additional points were made. 
Neither AAP (i.e., Association of American Publishers) nor CALS50565656495355
Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support) has a document-type
definition for ancient Greek drama, although 50565753565655 will be able to
handle that.  Given this state of affairs and assuming that the
technical-journal produce50565748525755the commercial 50565755575056decide to use the
other two types, then an institution like the Library of Congress, which
might receive al50565757535356ir publi50565756495155, would have to b50565752535257 handle

Office D50565751565056Architecture (ODA) has some advantages that flow from its
tight focus on office 50565757534856s and clear directions for implementation. 
Much 50574853554855ODA standard is easier to read5056575355484948er at first reading
than the SGML 5056575357555650565757535455 is extremely general.  What that means is
that if one wants to use graphics in TIFF and ODA, one is stuck, because
ODA defines 50565755514957formats while TIFF does not, whereas SGML says the
world is not waiting for this work group to create another 5056575749534953.
What is needed is an ability 50574854515055whateve50565757504849555057484952504948.

50574856544857.  SGML is less megalomaniacal in attempting to define50574854525256

The final speaker in this session, Eric 50574956555056, vice president,
Chadwyck-Healey, Inc., spoke505749555256494850574957544849505057495753544953re
t5057504853524950, rather than as one qualified to discuss methods of
encoding data, and observed 50575054515057presenters sitting 50575055574855room,
whe50574956495755ey had chosen to or not, were acting as 50575051575757s:  making
choices, gather50574957515049485057495648574948information, and making assessments. 5057505449554948offered the hard-won conviction that in 50575054564955ing very large
text files (such as PLD), one cannot avoi50575048565557personal judgments of
appropriateness and structure.

In50575053545557's view, 505750525251494850575056485757stem from prior 50575049554857.  Two
notions have become axioms for him 50575053535455considerat50575149494855future sources
for electronic publication:  1)5057505050504950text 5057505350574949is as p50575052565655
as any other kind of 5057505450504948, and questions of if and how to encode
the data are simply a consequence of that prior 50575152505356;  2) all
505750555649575057515256514950e open to criticism, which is unavoidable.

50575148515057rehearsed his role as 5057515157484950or, better, as an intermediary
between what is viewed as a sound idea and the people who would make use
of it.  Finding the specialist to advise in this process is the core of
that function.  The p50575156485057must monitor and hug the fine line 50575057505655
giving users what they want and suggesting 5057505648504948might need.  One
responsibility of a5057514954564949is to represent the desires of scholars and
research librarians as opposed to bullheadedly forcing them into areas
they would not choose to enter5057515349544950likened the 5057515550524948being raised today about data 50575248554957
and standards to the de50575248575156faced by the Abbe Migne himself during
production of the Patrologia series 50575249565155mid-nineteenth century. 
Chadwyck-Healey's 5057524853505650575153574956oduc50575151534855's Latin 50575151514855whole and
complete with SGML tags was also based upon a perceived need and an
expected use.  In the same way that 50575152575256work came to be far more than
a simple handbook for clerics, PLD is already f5057515348564950 a database
for theologians.  It is a bedrock source for the study of Western
civilization, 50575254545057asserted.

In regard5057524948514954 to 50575157555656and 50575253525155 PLD, the editorial board
offered direct judgments on the 50575251535056 of appropriateness of these
texts for conversion, their encoding and their distribution, and
concluded that the best possible project was one that avoided overt
intrusions or exclusions in so important a resource.  Thus, the general
5057525451524950transmit the original collection as clearly as 50575249534957with
the wide5057525048494950avenues for use led to other d50575348494856:  1) To encode
the data or not, SGML 50575248575656TEI50575249504855.  Again505752544849555057525749534949r
community asserted the need for normative tagging structures of 50575253495457
humanities texts, and the TEI seemed the most 50575256495749495057525152544948 for
that purpose.  Research librarians, who are trained to view the larger
impact of electronic text50575350525255s on 80 or 90 or 100 doctoral
disciplines, loudly approved 5057535148534954include50575255535056.  They see

potential uses exceed present expectations.  2) What will be tagged and
what will not.  Once a5057535150554948board realiz50575354575156one must tag the
obvious.  But in no way should one attempt to identify through 50575357495156
schemes every single discrete area of a text that might someday be
searched.  That was an5057535650504952.  Searching by a column number, an
author, a word, a volume, permitting combination 5057534952515550575356524856agging
notations50575356555256logical choices as core elements.  3) How does one mak5057544955524949available?  Tieing it to a CD-ROM50575355545357creates limitations,
but a magnetic tape file t50575357525655very large, is accompanied by the
50575354565656 specifications,50575451515755at allows one to make local modi50575351554857
also 5057535156534952incorporate any change50575354515356y desire within the
bounds of private research, though exporting tag files from50575355545457
could serve just as well.  Since no one on t50575451485057could possibly
anticipate each and every way in which a scholar50575450565155choose to mine
this data bank, it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some
provisions for wh50575452575757come.  4) Not to encode the database would rob
it of the interchangeability and port50575355575756these important texts should
accommodate.  For CALALUCA, the extensive options presented by full-text50575456565055ing require care in text selection and strongly support50575548565257 of
data to facilitate the widest 50575452545455e search strategies.  Better
software can always be50575457524955d, but summoning the resources, the people,
and the energy to reconvert the text is another matter.

PLD is being encoded, captured, and distributed, because to
Chadwyck-Healey and 5057545755554948it offers 5057545353505048array of
future50575549564957 appli50575551535055 that can be seen today.  50575456535256 concluded

HOCKEY prefaced the discussion that followed with several comments in
favor of c5057555757545055nd on t5057564849534955.  In the
future, when many more texts are available for on-line searching, real
problems in finding what is wanted will 50575648565255, if one is faced with
millions of words of data.  It therefore becomes important to consider
putting 50575653495755in texts to help searchers home in on the actual things
they wish to retrieve.  Various approaches to refining 50575556515655al methods
toward this end include building on a computer 50575654485356of a dictionary
and letting the 50575557535057look up words in it to obtain more information
about the semantic structure or 50575648495157field of a word, its grammatical
50575648565657, and syntact5057564951564950.5057565649575750575655555355ed 50575652534855present keen interest 5057575049545650575656485155 world
in 50575656565156:  1) machine-readable 50575750505055s of d50575652575056ies that can be
initially tagged in SGML, which gives a5057565350494949to the di50575654535556 entry;
these entries can then be converted into a more rigid or otherwise
different database 5057565554514948inside505756565556495150575653545256can be treated as
a dynamic tool for 50575751555157 mechanisms; 2) large bodies of text to study
the language.  In order to incorporate more sophisticated 5057565454494948,
more about how50575753535055behave needs to be known5057565651534953learned in
part from5057575153534950 in 5057574952574950.  However, the last ten years have
seen much 5057575152504950study505757535652565057575350484949f printed 5057575153554950

many words from those is only partial, one or two definitions of the
common or the usual meaning o5057575748504948and then numerous5057574854514953
unusual usages.  If the5148484951574948is using a d5057575649564948to help retrieve
words in a text, it50575753555655much more 5057575354514950about 50575756535555mon usages,
because those are the one51484849515555occur over and over again.  Hence the
current 5148485151544950developing 5148484850575049in c5057575552534954
form in 51484848545757study5057575750525551484849505157Several projects are engaged in
compiling, for example, 100 million words. HOCKEY described one with
which she was associated briefly at Oxford University involving5057575449565551484849535255f 5057575451534955 of British English:  about 10 percent of
that will contain detailed linguistic tagging encoded in SGML; it will
have word class taggings, with51484855524955identified as nouns, verbs,
adjectives, or other parts of speech.  This 50575756565156can then be used by
programs which will begin to learn a bit more 51484853495449485148485748564951the
514848515551565148485552494948, can go to tag more text.

51484851555655said that the more that 51484848575755ed accurately, 50575757555657one can
refine the 51484851515756process and thus the bigger body 5148485554535651484848565355 build

for a long time to come, because building these large bodie51484855495557 is
extremely expensive and will only be done once.

In the more general discussion on approaches to 5148485750545651484948575356llowed,
these points were made:

BESSER51484957515656ied the underly51484954555655blem with standards that all have to
struggle with in adopting a 51484857535156, nam51484956565557tension between a very
highly defined 5148494855515651485048504857very interchangeable but does not work
for everyone because something is lacking, and 514849505056494851484949555557less
51484950495755, more open51484949495155adaptable, but less5148495056554954.  Contending
that the way in51484957574955people use SGML is not sufficient5148495256514948, BESSER
wondered 1) if 51484951495255resist the TEI51484957515457they think it is too51484954525556
in certain things they do not fit into, and 2) how progress with
in5148495554574949ility can be made without frightening people away.

SPERBERG-McQUEEN replied th51484955545455published drafts of the TEI had met
with surprisingly little objection on the ground514850505356555148495648514950allow
one to handle X or Y or Z.  Particular concerns51484955545556affiliated
projects have led, in practice, to 5148505452524948s of how extensions are to
51485048524855; the primary 51484956535655 of any 51484956544955 has to be how it can be
represented locally, thus making5148505454494950 secondary.  T51485049575557s
received much criticism based on the notion that every51485055555655n it is
required or even recommended, which, as it happens, is a misconception
from the beginning,   51485148485556none of it is 51485049535357and very 51485053565655is
actually actively 5148505051504949 for all cases, except that one document
one's source5148505655545048agreed with BESSER about this trade-off:  all the5148505557514948in a set of twenty TEI-conformant51485055545756s will not necessarily
tag the material in the same way.  One result of t51485152504855will be 51485150535056
easiest problem51485052575055be solved--those dealing with the external form of
the information; but the problem that is hardest in i5148514954554949is that
one is not encoding what another wants, and vice versa.  Thus, after
the adoption of a common notation, the differences51485057535056underlying
5148515149544948s of what is interesting 51485149555755exts become more visible.
The success of a standard like th5148514954484949lie in the ability 51485149505155recipient of i5148515556524948d texts to use some 51485148485057t contains
and to add t5148515057504952 that wa5148515053554949ed t5148515456485651485150554955in a
layered way, so51485153495155exts can be gradually enrich51485156575255one does not
have to put in 5148524948574949all at once.  Hence, having a well-behaved
markup scheme is important.

STEVENS followed up on the paradoxical analogy that 51485248575756lluded to in
the example 51485248485555MARC records, namely, the formats that are 51485249515256
e5148525153544949they are 51485156565556t.  51485152525056drew a parallel between
document-type definitions and 5148515255564950 for books and serials and maps,
where one has a tagging structure and there is a text-5148525154524949. 
51485155575056opin5148524848565651485252535755ducers514851555552565148524948484950will set the terms
for the s51485251485556(i.e., develop 514851564857505451485154505656users

an institution 51485254484857Library of Congress, which will 51485252515256deal with
the DTD51485256525457event that a multiplicity of them51485248505156s.  Thus,
numerous people are seek5148524851505551485257504956but cannot find the tag51485250504855at
w51485249485655acceptable to them 51485251565355ir clients.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed
with this view, and sai51485252555449495148525151534948was in a way worse:  attempting
to unify arbitrary DTDs resembled a51485248575557 to 514852494856555148525754554950 with a
bibliographic51485249515056done accord51485249565655the Prussian instructions. 
A514852504852495051485350535155, this 5148525553554948occurred very early51485254574856process.

WATERS recalled from early discussions on Project Open Book the concern
of many 51485256495555that merely by producing images, POB was not really
enhancing intellectual access51485254555256material.  Nevertheless, not wishing
to overemphasize the opposition between imaging and full text, WATERS
state51485353565455POB views getting the images as a first step toward possibly
convert5148534951505551485255485657 through character recognition, if the technology
is appropriate.  51485349505155also 5148525750575751485352515255encoding is involved even
with a set of images.

5148535448575051 with 51485351515355that one can create an SGML document
consisting wholly 5148525753494948  At first sight, organizing 51485354555156images514853485454555148534848554953 may not seem to offer great advantages, but the
5148525757504948 of the scheme 51485355535555described would be precisely that
ability to move into something that is more of a multimedia 51485351555156:
a combin51485448515655f trans51485350534855text and page5148535253484948WEIBEL concurred in
this judgment, offering evidence from 51485449535656ADAPT, where a page is
divided into text elements and 5148535455495651485351485556, and in fact51485357545655xt
e51485351554957re organized by columns and lines.  These lines may be used as
the basis for distributing 51485448495356s in a network environment.  As one
develops software intelligent enough to 51485451554955ze what those 51485355555756
are, it makes sense to apply SGML to an image initially, that may, in
fact, ultimately become more and more text, either 51485454575056OCR or edited
51485354565656ven just 51485455554856keying.  For WATERS, the labor of composing the
d51485453565056and saying this 514854564852555148544952514948or 5148535650494950images belongs
to this 51485455525057constitutes a significant investment.

51485453574955also made the point that the AAP tag sets, while not excessively
prescriptive51485455505455 a common starting point; they do not define the
structure of the 51485454525657, though.  They have some recommendations about
DTDs one could use as examples, but51485450535657just suggest t51485451555555.   For
example, the CORE p51485549525255attempts to use 51485453484956markup as much as
possible, 51485451535655re are clearly areas where 5148545351534948must be added. 
That in no way contradicts the use of 5148545554574950.

SPERBERG-McQUEEN noted 51485456534957TEI prepared a long working paper early
on about5148545754564954 and what it lacke5148545354554953thought it
needed, and a fairly long critiqu51485548514857naming conventions, which has
led to a very different style of 51485454544855in 51485456515255.  He stressed the
importance51485550545256opposition between 514855515757495051485549535255, the kin51485548505155a
publisher or anybody can do when producing 5148555550534948de novo, and
d5148545656564957in which one has to take what the text carrier
provides.  In these particular t51485556505755 it is easy to overemphasize this
o51485549555657, beca514855545452495051485552525056is extremely flexible.  Even if one
just used the DTDs, they allow almost anything to appear5148554855494949where.

Marybeth PETERS, policy planning adviser to the Register of 51485650564857s,

5148575350514951s for two purposes:  1) to encourage the creation and
dissemination of intellectual work51485753574955he good of society as a whole;
and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package 51485755525649525149485449524950the economic reward51485757515155are due them.

51485757555057strives to strike a balance, which at times can become an
emotional issue514948495652565149485650494951has never accepted the not51494851535255the
natural right of an author so much as it has 514857575255505551494855575655good and the desirability of incent51494849545556promote it.  This state
of affairs, however, has created strains on the international level and
is the reason for several 51494948515755differences in the laws that we have. 
Today 514949505248495651494950525155s almost every kind of work that can be
called an express514949495150555149485354535751494948565555standard for gaining 51494950565757
protection is simply originality51494854485556is a low5149485155514948and means that
a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain
minimal amount of authorship.  One can also acquire c514949525551575149485453514948
for making a new version of preexisting 51494951555456, provided it manifests
some spark of creativity.

H514949495254565149485457554948does not 51494948525255 ideas, methods, systems--only the way
that one expresses those things.  Nor does 5149485750484955 anything
that is mechanical, a51494855534855 that 51494856575357involve choice, or criteria
concerning whether or not one should do a thing.  For example, the
results of a process called declicking, in which one 5149494855554948ly removes
impure sounds from old recordings, are 51494953555555yrightable.  On the other
hand, the51494950515455 to record a song digitally and to increase th51494949555355 of
violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the re51494951565057con51494955554855

5149505149504955, one generally needs the permi51495051504857the c51495051484957owner to convert it.  Normally, who will own the new--51494957535655, converted-

do not 5149495555524948think about 5149495556554951 implications until after the
fact.  PETERS stressed the need when dealing with 51495054545357ed works to
th51494955545449485149504948564950 advance.  One's bargaining power is much greater

all 5149515350514948distribution are extinguished with the sal51495154534855at copy. 
The key is that it must be sold.  A number of companies overcome this
obstacle by leasing or renting their product.  These 5149515351564948argue that

The way 5149525650524948law is worded gives much latitude to activities 51495256545055
preservation; to use of 51495350525057for scholarly and research purposes when
the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of
facsimi51495253514857 of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and
other 51495253574957.  But the law 51495255515457allow anyone to become the
distributor of the 5149535257515651495255535155 entire world.  In today's electronic
environment, 51495256575756rs are extremely concerned th514953535053555149525652504950 is
networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a

Noting5149535152515052is a membe51495357514857Berne Convention and
subscribes to its provisions, PETERS described the permissions process. 
She also defined compulsory51495355555257.  A5149535253534957, of which the
5149535552534952has had a few, builds into the law the right to use a work
subject to certain terms and conditions.  In t5149535752565050,
however, the ability 514953555050555149535654524957 is 5149545356514948limited. 
Thus, clearinghouses 5149545150574948collectives comprise one op5149545057574948has
succeeded in providing for use of a work.  Often overlooked when one
begins to use copyrighted material and put products together is how
expensive 5149545251535051 and managing it is.  According to
PETERS, the price of 51495449494857 in a digital medium, whatever 51495456545057is
worked out, will include5149544955504948and assembling the database.  She
strongly recommended that 5149554951504949and librarians or people with
various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible
systems, in order to produce better results.

51495457545255lengthy question-and-answer perio51495453485655followed PETERS's
presentation, the following points emerged:

     * The Co51495456495056Office maintains that anything mechanical and
     totally exhaustive probably is not protected.  51495552505055event that

     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not 51495455505455.  As a
     practical matter, if one believes she or he has made enough of those51495457525355hoices, that person has a right to assert a5149555551564949and someone
     else must51495457515156that the work 514955515248555149555054574951.  The mor5149555057565651495552545357, the more automatic, a thing is, the less likely it is to

     image.  Thus, a 5149555153534948ic5149555356554949re51495649505555s what is called 51495555565055"thin"5149555754574948514955545052555149555349514948 itself must be duplicated, in

However, control over a scientific 514955575650495351495654555155y a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., 51495657515255 wh51495656485455receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy.  If
     the 5149564852544948 agency has no51495648545255 (and that 51495648535155can be51495654545556ntained in its regulation51495749555655contract, or the grant), the
     author retains c5149574849524949If a provision of 5149565053564952grant, or5149565255515651495651505356 states that there will be no 51495750535757, then it does 51495748575357exist.  When a work is created, co51495751574856automatically comes into5149565249504949ence unless something exist51495653515355says 51495653505149495149575251524948An 51495750575255d electronic copy of a print5149565254524948n older reference51495752525355ork i5149575150514957 that 51495655545156514956575649565149575450494953new5149575349525551495752575656is a purely 5149575455524948 rendit5149574849554949original work, 51495753574957is not514957525656495351495656574857Usually, wh5149574852574948enters th5149575549494953, nothing can remove51495656495655t.  For example, Congress recently passed into law51495752545356cept of51495752545157omatic renewal, which mean514957525153555149575154514948on any work publishe51495749485555between l964 and l9785149575055514948have to be renewed in order 5149575350495651495757535255 a seventy-five-year term.

     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 28
     March through 2 April l993, at Harvard University, on digital51495756515355echnology, and will study this entire issue. 51495756495656purchases a
     computer 51495756535457package, such as MacPaint, and creates something
     new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.

PETERS added that often in 5150485455484948matters, rough justice is the
outcome, for 51504856555257in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American
Society of Composers, Authors, and P51504857515255rs), and BMI51495757565456Broadcast
Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys 51504948505656more than their
due.  Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without
paying for it; there should be some compensation.  But the truth of the
world, and it is not a great truth, is th5150485249544952 gets played on
the radio more frequently 51504852575156 little guy, who has to do much more
until he becomes a 51504854525055.  That is true of every author, every
composer51504851555555one, and, unfortunately, is part of life.

Co51504948555456always originates with the 51504853535757xcept in cases of works
made for hire.  (Most 51504952495357falls into this category.)  When an author
sends his article to a journal, he has not relinquished c51504952555356, though
he retains the right to 5150485549494948 it.  Th515048565755565150495457554948absolutely
everything51504855535255less prominent5150494850534951the more leverage the
p51504954524956 will have in contract negotiations.  In order to transfer the
rights, 5150495053494948 must sign an agreement giving them away.

In an electronic society, it is important to be able to license a writer
and work out deals.  With regard to use of a work, it usually is much
easier when a p51504951525757hold5150495348544949515049515351555150495056494952era, a real
problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available. 
PETERS referred again to 5150495350514949licensing clearinghouses.  51505048574957
ough51504956564855main 5150504950514955but as one moves forward globally in the
e5150495554554948arena, a middleman who can handle the various5150495548535551505052575756
increasingly necessary.

The notion of 51505050564957 law is that it reside5150505349574949individual, but
in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
by many in51504954565256s, there is concern.  If changes ar51505053565656ized and
51504954575557no5150505252574949to the contrary, the perso515050485054555150495556515651505052525155wns

some 5150504948505053 has been made.  It is typical for the
original 5150505651534948to try to control all of the versions and 5150504850514948
5150505556484954 law always only sets up the boundaries.  Anything can be
changed by contract.

In his role as moderator 51505254534855concluding session, GIFFORD raised two
5150524957574948he believed would benefit from discussion:  1) Are there enough
commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And, if
so, what are they and who might take them?  2) Partly derivative from
that, but obviously very dangerous to LC as host, do you see a role for
the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course, 5150525152545051
holds a rather special status in a numbe51505256554856se matters, because it is
not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them, but 51505255565155re
role51505257515555LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?

Describing himself as an uninformed observer51505351505356technica5150535050565551505353525555last515053504956575150535156554948detected three different emphases 51505350535255Workshop: 
1) 51505355555755who are very deeply committed to text; 2) 5150525556554953almost
passionate about images; and 3) a few51505257495050495150525749554950
what happens to the networks.  In other words, the new 51505257495155ing
dimension, the accessibility of the processability, the porta51505257574957
51505354545056 across 5150534950494953How do we pull those three together?

Adding a ques5150544852554948reflected HOCKEY's comment that this was the
fourth workshop she had attended 51505449575255previous thirty days, FLEISCHHAUER
wondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel, or if it
had contributed anything 51505356555655way of bringing 51505353545556 a 5150535754564948group
of 51505357545155from51505354544955who normally appear o5150535253505551505354515056circuit.

HOCKEY confessed to being struck at5150535453524952and the one the
Electronic Pierce Consortium organiz5150535553515551505356535157week 5150535752524952a
coming 51505355555057515053555452494851505450495755 on texts and no51505451564856.  Attempting to
bring the two 51505357515257is something we ought to be thinking about for the
future:  How one can think5150545451525551505356544956with image material to begin
with, but structuring it and digitiz51505355575455in such a way that at a later
stage it can be interpreted into text, and find a common 51505452545756uilding
text and images5150545349564948so51505455535156ey can be used jointly 51505455545055future,
with5150554857554950 support51505450524857 there because that is how 51505453484856ill
want to access it.

In planni51505453505155long-term development of 51505453545457, which is what is
being done in el51505456505357text, 51505457504855str51505457505755he importance not only
of discuss51505456485657echnical aspects of how one does it but particularly
of 5150545657534953what the p51505548525055ho use the stuff will want to do.
But conversely, there are numerous things that 51505552524855start to do with
5150545456504953 or5150554950554949hat nobody ever thought of 51505457555455beginning.

LESK, in response to the question concerni51505552525155role of the Library of
Congress, remark51505554525755often suggested desideratum of having 5150554857514948
deposit:  Since everything is now computer-typeset, an entire decade of
5150545755534952was machine-readable exists, but the publishers frequently
did not save it; has LC taken any action to have its copyright 51505548524855
operation start collect51505554545355se 5150554852504955versions?  In the
absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied th5150555448535551505552484957was being
actively considered but that th51505550575555only one dimension51505553505056problem.
Another 5150554856574948is the whole 5150555452555751505554515255integrity of the original5150555651514950document.  It becomes highly 51505649525056t in science to prove
authorship.  How will that be done?

ERWAY explained that, under the old policy, to make a claim for a
5150555554494948for work51505650525055were 51505556575256d in 5150565054534949form, including
software, one had to submit a paper copy51505650545656first and last twenty
pages of code--something that represent51505651554855work but 51505650485056include
the 51505651514955work itself and had little value to anyone.  As a temporary
measure, LC has claim51505654495655right to demand 515056494957494951505651545356 of
5150564954534949publications.  This measure entails a proactive role for the
Library to say that it wants a particular 5150555748494956.  P51505656485257
then have perhaps a year t51505650525357it.  B51505657495055real 51505654524955 for LC is
what to do with all this material in all these different formats.  Will
the 51505649535256mount it?  51505655485257it give people access to 51505648505457does LC
keep track 51505657575655appropriate computers, 5150565550574948and media?  The situation
is so hard to control, ERWAY said, t51505653485155makes sense for each 51505657545455ing
house to maintain its own archive51505653535055LC cannot enforce that either.

GIFFORD acknowledged LESK's suggestion51505651495555sta51505652485256 a priority
offered the solution, albeit a fairly complicated one.  But wh5150565353524948s
that register?, he asked.  GRABER noted that LC does attempt to collect a
Macintosh51505750555556 and the IBM-compatible51505653495357of 51505754505756.  It does
not 51505654485156other5150575251545751505655515157ile true for 5150574856504948BYRUM observed,
this reply does not speak to materials, that is, 515057515557555150565455524948 that

BYRUM said, would be beyond LC's capability at the moment, insofar as
attempting 5150575055484948, organiz51514848524855preserve them are concerned--and
51505749495655ation5150575052494948the most important consideration.  In this
connection, 51514848575756reiterat51514848535555need to work out some51514850565355of
distributive responsi51505752575055for a number of these issues, which
inevitably will require significant cooperation and discussion.
Nobody can do it all.

LESK5151485257485651514851535256some 51514849504956rs may look with favor on LC beginning
to serve as a depository of tapes in an electronic manuscript standard. 
P5150575452484952view this as a service that they did not have to perform
and they might send in tapes.  However, SPERBERG-McQUEEN countered,
although5150575751524950have had equivalent 51505756525055s available to them for a
long time, the 5151484848534949text archive has never turned away or been
flooded with tapes and is forever sending feedback to the5151485053514948. 
S5151485153484953do 5151484955524952

ANDRE viewed this 5151485348534948 as an allusion 51514848524955issue of 51514852495656s. 
She recommended t51514852505355 AAP51514853484857 and the TEI51514855545655 has already been
somewhat harmonized internationally and which also shares several
compatibilities with the AAP, be 5151485051564949to ensure sufficient5151485052544951y in the software.  She drew the line at saying LC ought to
be the locus or forum for such harmonization.

Taking the group in a slightly different direction, but one where at
least51514853534856near term LC might play a helpful role, LYNCH remarked the
plans of a number of projects to carry out preservation by creating
digital images that will end up in on-line or near-line storage at some
institution.   Presumably, LC will link this material somehow to its
51514855535056catalog in most cases.  Thus, it is in a 51514856565356form.  LYNCH had
the impression that many of these in51514857515257s would be willing to make
those files accessi51514957495155other people outside the i5151494949504948, provided
that there is no copyright problem.  This desideratum will require
propagating the knowledge 51514957505555ose digitized files exist, so 51515048485056y
can 5151495257494949ther 5151495249494953s.  Although uncertain about the
mechanism for achieving this result51514956484856said that it warranted
scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some51514954515155 basic issues of
cataloging and distribution of records.  It w51514955525656 foolish, given the
amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to
discover multiple 51514957575749515151495648525551515052565756same work.  Re microforms,
5151495553484948, we are in pretty good shape.

BATTIN called this a big51515048575756 and noted t51515049545155 Cornell 51515050515555(who
had already departed) were working on it.  At issue from the beginning
was to learn 5151505449565551515054495256that information into RLIN and then into
OCLC5151505156544948it w515150545152565151505449544948.  That issue remains51515051495255resolved. 51515048565355rejoine51515052505055putting it into OCLC or RLIN was helpful insofar as
somebody who is thinking of performing preservation activity on that work
could learn about it.  It is not necessarily 51515048565556for 5151505353514951to
mak51515148485155available.  51515053505455op5151505053484948the idea was t51515057524955not only be
for 5151505052544951purposes but for the convenience of people looking for
this material.  She endorsed LYNCH's dictum that duplication of this
effort wa51515054545156avoided by every means.

HOCKEY51515056515155ed the Workshop51515054485655one major current 5151505457524948f CETH,
namely a 51515152495255ue of machine-readable texts in the humanities.  Held on
RLIN at present, the c51515052565457has been concentrated on ASCII as opposed
to digitized images of text51515056495755is exploring ways to improve the
c51515055505257and make it more widely a51515149495656, and welcomed suggestions
about these concerns.  CETH owns the records, which are not just
restricted to RLIN, and can distribute them however it wishes.

Taking up LESK's earlier question, 51515153485255inquired whether LC, since it
is accepting electronic files and designing a mechanism for dealing with
that rather than putting books on shelves, would become responsible for
the National Copyright Depository of E5151514952514948M51515156515455s.  Of course
that could not be accomplished overnight, but it w51515150484955 something LC
could plan for.  GIFFORD acknowledge51515250494855much thought was being devoted
to that set of problems and return51515249495655discussion to the issue raised
by LYNCH--51515154575256or not 51515154495156the kind of 51515157485455 that both51515156495356and
51515251535355have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. 
It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning
some51515154505457directory for these kinds of ma5151515756484948In a situation
where somebody is attempting to decide5151525150505751515156545455to scan this or
fil51515155555355or to learn 5151515755504953someone has already done so, LYNCH
suggested, 51515157565756helpful515152514853575151524851495551515155495055 in the case of a local,
on-line catalogue.  Further, one would like to have 51515251495055his system be
aware that that exists in digital form, s51515253504955one can present it to a
patron, even51515254515355 one did not digitize it, if it is out of co51515257494855. 
The only way to make those linkages 51515257484857to perform a tremendous
amount of real-time look-up, which 51515348515457awkward at best, or
periodically to yank the whole file from 51515256515655d match it against one's
own stuff51515250555256is a nuisance.

But where, ERWAY inquired, does one stop including thing51515349575555are
available with Internet, for instance, in one's local5151525655494948?
It almost seem51515351555555that is LC's means to acquire access to them.
That re5151525749565551515252525355new form of library loan.  Perhap515152525553494951515349545155
51515349555157 is an amalgamation of all5151535348565551515350535557s on line.  LYNCH
conceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term, but was not
applicable 51515354525155ning 51515353505755short term.  In his view, the totals cited
by Yale, 10,000 books over51515256525657a four-year period, and 1,000-1,500
books from Cornell, were not big numbers, while searching all over
creation for relatively rare occurrences will prove to be less efficient. 
As GIFFORD wondered if thi51515356515056not be a separable file on 51515355545056
co51515357495755requested from them, BATTIN interjected that it was easily
accessible to an institution.  SEVERTSON pointed ou51515356484955that file, cum
enhancements, was 5151535755514953reference inform51515355575755n CD-ROM51515450545555
makes it a little more a51515449504956.

In HOCKEY's 5151535555534948real question facing the Workshop is what to put in
this 51515450525757, because that raises the 51515351575557of what constitutes a
publication 51515449525555electronic world.  (WEIBEL5151535557554956Eric Joule
in OCLC's Office of Research is also wrestling with this particular
problem, while 51515449495256thought it sounded fairly generic.)  HOCKEY
contended that a majority of texts51515454494956humanities are 51515354505656ands
of either a small number of large re515153565552565151545057534948s or individuals
and are not generally 5151545150484948for anyone else to access at all.
She 5151545451564952ese51515357555455ought to be 51515451495757d.

After argument proceeded back and forth for several minutes over why
51515452565056ing might be a necessary service, LEBRON suggested 51515456485355is
issue involved the responsibil51515451565055a publisher.  The fac51515457525155someone
has created something 5151545550554948ally and keeps it under his or her
control does not 5151545656524948 publication.  P5151545750514950mplies
dissemin51515449575156While it would be important for a scholar to let other
people know5151545350564948 creation exists, in many respects this is no
different from an un51515454505656d manuscript.  That 51515552495756is being accessed
in there, except that now one is not looking at it 51515550495757rd-copy but515154534851555151555350524950environment.

51515548485755expressed puzzlement at the variety of ways 515154535753494951515548545555ing
has been viewed.  Much of what 51515454484957discussed throughout these two
days has concerned CD-ROM5151545552534949, whereas 51515555505355on-line e5151545657504948
that she confronts, the constraints and challenges are very 51515549575657. 
Sooner or later LC will have to deal with 51515456565755cept of 51515457535755
p51515549495157.  Taking up51515457564855mment ERWAY made earlier about storing
copies51515556545757gave her own journal as an example.  How would she deposit
OJCCT for copyright?, she asked, because the 51515548575556will exist51515554515455
mainframe at OCLC and 51515556565555will be able to access it.  Here the
situ51515648545655s 51515557515457, ownership versus51515557505255, and is 5151565055564948that
arises with 51515650534849495151555552575055, faster than is
sometimes realized.  Lacking clear answers to all of these questions
herself51515555515057did not anticipate that LC would 5151555452534949take a role
in helping to define some51515553495655m for quite a while.

GREENFIELD observed that LC's Network Development Office is attempting,
among other things, to explore the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling 5151565454514949information.  5151555557564949also not51515556495456Rebecca
GUENTHER from that office gave a paper to the American Society for
I5151555651524948 Science (ASIS) summarizing several of the discussion papers
that were coming out 5151555653515551515649565550545151564855564952said
he understoo515156505752555151564948484950had a list-server soliciting just the kind

5151565648564948war51515655555655at and somehow contribute to that conversation.

Noting two of LC's roles, first, to act as a repository of record for
material that is copyrighted in this country, and second, to make51515651525657s it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that
goes beyond Congress, BESSER suggest51515751505656it was incumbent on LC to
extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in
e5151575157514948form.  This would mean eventually accepting5151575348504949
formats.  LC could require that at some point they be in a certain

LC does that with most of its bibliographic records, 51515752485256aid, which
end up migrating to the utility (e.g., OCLC) or somewhere else.  But just
as 51515749495456LC's book515157505449555151575550534955form through interlibrary

considerations.  BESSER was not 51524848555055ing t51515754575555se 5151575651564949be
established tomorrow, on5151575648514951seemed to fall within LC's purview,
and that there should be long-range plans to e51515753484856 them.

Acknowledg5151575356534949ose from LC 51524849534955room agreed with BESSER
concerning the need to confront difficult questions, GIFFORD underscored
the magnitude of the problem of what to keep and 51515754484956select.  51515754565455
noted that LC currently receives some 31,000 items per day, not counting
e5152485054544948material51524855535655argued for much more distributed responsibility
in order to maintain and store 5152485255544949information.

51524855515255responde5152485149564948 assembled group could be viewed as a starting
point, whose initial operating premise co51524852575355help51524857534855move in this
direction and defining how LC could do so, for example, in areas of
standardization or 51524851535657ion of 5152485156514952.

FLEISCHHAUER ad51524851535657AM was fully engaged, wrestling 5152494857494948of the
51524855575357 that pertain to the convers51524851495755older historical 5152485550574948
which w51524949485156one thin5152495053524948 Library of Congress might do.  Several
points mentioned by 51524952495355and several others on this51524949575057 have a
much greater impact on those who are concerned with cataloguing and the
networking of bibliographic5152494951514950, as well as preservation itself.

Speaking directly to AM, which he considered was a largely uncopyrighted
database, LYNCH urged development of a 51524856485555 v5152494856494948AM, or
5152485553505651524950555555f making the data in it available to people interested in
doing 51524856515056multimedia.  On account51524951555255 current great shortage of
digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights
problems, this course of action could have a significant effect on making515249525155565152494953554949 a rea51524956535055I51524953575455connection, 5152495748534951reported on a fragmentary prototype in
LC's Office of In51524954525757 Technology Service51525048495055attempts to associate51524952515457images of photographs w51524956565449545152495654494949 in ways that
work within a local are51524955575757--a step, so to say, toward AM's
construc51524956544956some sort of apparatus for access.  Further, AM has
51524953525355ed to use standard data forms in order to help make that
distinction between the access tools and the underlying data, and thus
believe5152495651545551525050545256base is 51525053514955able.

A delicate and agonizing policy question for LC, however51525053555356comes
back to resources and unfortunately has an impact on this, is to find
some appropriate, honorable, and legal cost-recovery possibilities.  A
certain skittishness concerning 5152495649494952has made51525056505556unsure
exactly what to do.  AM would be highly receptive to discussing further
LYNCH's offer to test or demonstrate its 5152505149504948n a 51525056555055
environment5152505654574953said.

Returning the d51525048565755on to what she viewed as the vital issue of
electronic deposit, BATTIN recommended that LC initiate a catalytic
process in terms of distributed responsibility, that is, bring together
5152505152555551525050495457organizations and set up a study group to look at all
these issu51525056564855see where we as a nation should move.  The broader
51525051534955of how we deal with the management of 5152505454494949information will
not disappear, but only grow worse.

LESK took up this theme and suggest515250565053494951525153555055 to persuade one
major library in each state to d51525054575557its state equivalent publisher,
which might produce a cooperative project that 51525151555757equitably
5152514950504950around the country, and one in which LC 51525153504957dealing with
a minimal number of 51525056555357s and 51525055534956copyri51525057495055blems.

GRABER remarked the recent development in the scientific community of a
willingness to use SGML and either 51525154565255 or interchange on a fairly
standardized format.  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place
in the humanities.  Although the National L51525153515055of Medicine found only
a few5152515156504950to 51525153525356e in a like venture two or three years ago, a
new effort might generate a much larger 51525154485255515251525750555152515056484951.

KIMBALL recounted his unit's (Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room)
troubles 51525250494957commercial 51525156545049495152525053564952media in acquiring
materials for LC's co51525152545357, in particular the 5152524852574948' fear that
they would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of
their products, 51525253505656would give them away or sell51525153515455nd make
profits from them.  He doub515252545657575152515555504949ing industry was prepared
to move into this area 51525154575055moment, given its resistance to allowing LC
to use its machine-readable 5152524857534948as the 5152525252565651525248505055ike.

The co51525255555656law now addresses compact disk as a medium, and LC can
request one copy of that, or two copies if it is the only version, and
can request 51525157525655of software, but that fails to address magazines or
books or anything like that which is in 5152525149514955form.

GIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue, which he illustrated
51525257515257example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a 51525252575456a
scientific database on a LAN in LC's science reading room.  He also
5152525253554953at LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents
of Workshop participants in thinking through a number51525254504855se problems5152525553524949returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to
think51525253564957together where they want to go in the long term.  MYLONAS
conced51525353495256her experience 51525353535255Pierce Symposium the previous week at
Georgetown University and this 51525254555355 LC had forced her to reevaluate
her perspective on the usefulness of text as images.51525257515557 framed the
issues in a series of questions:  How do we acquire 5152535750484954
text?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it
import51525350575055obtain very high-quality images51525352505357, etc.? 
FLEISCHHAUER agreed with 51525352505355's framing of strategic 51525350524957, adding
that a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those
things at different times.  Thus, the trick is to exercise judgment.  The
51525448495457had added to his and AM's considerations in ma51525448575355ose
51525351495156s.  Concerning future meetings or5152544952494949s, 51525356525156suggested
that screening priorities would be helpful.

WEIBEL opined th51525449554855di51525449514856reflected in this group was a sign both
of the health and 51525352535655immaturity 51525352575255field, and more time would
have to pass before we convince one another concerning standards.

An exchange between 51525452505756and BATTIN clarified the point that the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
the preservation of knowledge for the future, not simply for particular
research use.  In the case of 515253575255555152545151564949aid, the assumption was

This presentation explores the ways in which e5153525550484948texts are likely
to be used by the non-scientific sc51535348565356community.  Many of the
remarks are drawn from a report the speaker coauthored with Jeff
Rothenberg, a computer 51535257484955st at The RAND Corporation.

The 51535257484956assesses 1) current5153534850574949use of information technology

51535351525556515353515252555153535450574955is 51535354565455d broadly within the context of515353514852565153535456544948cation.  From the perspective of 51535355555657
c5153535055554950, the work of 5153535257504948 and 515353535256495451535353524956
involves five 51535354534855es:  1) identification of sources, 2) 5153535350574951
with colleagues, 3) interpre51535450505555and analysis of data, 4) dissemination
of 51535357515157findings, and 5) curriculum development and instruc51535356495455The

5153565349544957 (5) has just released 515356535653561.0, the first publicly
available version of its hypertextual database of multimedia materials on
c5153565550554953.  51535656515356is designed to be used by a wide audience,
comprised of readers at51535749544856dent51535755495657lar levels.  As such, it must
be able to locate51535754505656tion using different strate515357515049494851535656505756contain enough detail to serve the 5153565655514948needs of its users.  In
addition, 51535748485055 be delivered so that it is afforda51535748555255its target
a51535749575755.  [These 5153575556525551535757545655he solutions we chose are described in
Mylonas, "An Interface to 5153575450534952k Civilization," JASIS 43:2,
March 1992.]

In order to achieve its objective, the project staff decided to make a
conscious separation between selecting 51544850525655verting 51535756544855, 51535756554956,
and image data on the one hand, and putting it into a51535754535656y system on
the other.  That way, it is possi51535757495655create the 5154485249524949data
without thinking about the restrictions of the d5153575351494952.  We have
made a great effort to choose system-independent formats for our data,
and to put as much thought and work as 51535755534857into structuring it so
th51544852555555translation from paper to 5153575654514949form will enhance the value
51535756565056ata. [A discussion of these s51544851575757as of two years ago is in

Perseus Project:  Data in the El51544850565357Age," in Accessing Antiquity:

(eds.),  University of Arizona Press, in press.]

Much 51544853535755work on 51544849575756is focused on coll5154485655565051he
51544856545256which th5154494849534948is based.  At the same time, it is necessary to
provide means of access to the information, in 51544950535657make it usable51544856555755hem to investigate how51544949505355used.  As we learn more51544949505155what
students and scholars from different backgrounds do with51544854515256, we can
adjust 5154494957485651544854555557on, and also modify the system to accommodate
them.  In creating a5154495253504954 for general use, we have tried to
avoid favoring any one type of use by allowing multiple form5154485751524949
to and navigation through5154485554514949.

The way text is handled exemplifies some 51544953564957principles.  All text
in 5154495150524949tagged using SGML, fo51544856545356the guidelines of the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI).  This markup51544951485356 to index the text, and
process it so that it can be imported into HyperCard.  No SGML51544857535255
remains in the text that reaches the user, because currently it would be
too expensive to create a51544953525557hat acts on SGML in real time. 
However, the regularity 51544957515455d by SGML is essential for verify51545048575756content 51545049565755texts, and greatly speeds all the processing performed on51544956575256The fact that 51544950534957 exist i51544951565655ensures that they will be
relatively easy to port to 5154505048574948hardware and software, and so will
outlast the 515449545656555154505048494948platform.  Finally, the 5154495651564950incorporate51544953535255ing canonical reference51545052495355s (chapter, verse, line,
etc.); indexing an5154505153484951are based on51545051495555features5154505050525651544955575255
th51544956524955same 5154495454545048will always resolve to 51544954494957point
within a 5154505156515751545050495255ll versions of our 51545049525355regardless of 51544957545556
p51544957555455 (even paper printouts) will func5154505650505551544956564955way.

In order to provide tools for users, 51545054495657is 51545055504955ed by a
morphological analyzer, and the results are stored in a database. 
Together with the index, the Greek-English Lexicon5154495756544948index of all

tasks.  For example, students who read no Greek may explore a concept as
it appears in Greek texts by using 5154505353534949-Greek 5154505452505551545055495555n

use, the same tools 51545149575656same data can be used by both 51545057505457and

but surmountable ones if they remain abreast 51545250495355latest possibilities
in 51545249555755pture and retrieval software techniques.

The issues which required address prior to the commencement of the
51545155485557were legion:

     1.   Editorial selection (or exclusion) of materials in each
          51545248565656515451545351552.   Deciding whether or not to incorporate a normative encoding5154515551504949structure into the 51545251485456s?5154515649504949     A.  If one is selected, should it be SGML5154515648514955B.  If SGML, then the TEI51545156555555
     3.   Deliver as CD-ROM, magnetic tape, or both?

     4.   Can one produce 5154525156494957advanced enough for the
5154525055484948postdoctoral 51545255494956, yet accessible 5154524850514949unattende51545348515555     general use?  Should one try515452495755565.   Re fair and liberal networking policies, what are the risks to5154525451564949an 5154525755565048515452524953566.   How does the emergence of national and inter51545250485057education515452565354494951545251555155s affect the use and viability of 51545351525157515453514856565154525757524949requiring high investment?  Do the new European Community5154534951494950irectives concerning 51545349565056 protection necessitate two5154525255574951stinct publishing p51545352495155, one for North America and 515452525756555154535249524949overseas?

From new notions of "scholarly fair use"51545354534956future of optical media,
virtually every issue related to 5154534950484956ing was aired.  The
result is two51545348535657 which have been constructed to provide the quality
51545349565657resources with the fewest encumbrances to use by teachers and
private 51545348555255s.

approached by classics 51545352525255 David Packard on behalf of the 51545348525555

Howard BESSER             51555153515057Networking Multimedia Databases

What do we have to consider in building and distributing d51555154565456 of
visual 51555156555457 in a multi-user environment?  This515552545453495251555157524855s
a variety of concerns that51555248504856 be addressed before a multimedia
d51555157575355 can be set up in a 51555256485355ed 5155515754484949.

In the past it has not been feasible to implement5155524951534951 visual

Each of the two basic models for 515552515351494951555250545349485155525251494949has
posed its own problem.  The analog5155524951534950storage model (re51555253495555ed
by Project Athena's parallel 51555250495055and digital 51555253495355s) has required an
incredibly complex (and expensive) infrastructure51555252485555economies of
scale that make5155525656574950setups cheaper per user served do not operate
in an5155534848524950 that 51555253505355s a computer workstation, videodisc player,
and two display devices for each user.

The 5155535354505651555256525750535155525557494951vast amounts of 51555257505655
space (as much as one gigabyte per thirty still images).  5155535150524950the
cost of such a large amount5155525551494949 space made this model a
prohibitive choice as well.  But plunging 51555351485156costs are finally
making this second alternative viable.

I5155525748534948no longer poses such an impediment, what do we51555357485056
consider in building 51555353524955ly stored 51555355505649495155535657535057?  This 51555355504955ation will examine the networking and
telecommunication constraints that must be overcome before such 51555448495657
can become commonplace and useful to51555353515157number of people.

The key 51555449535055 is the vast size of 5155545053504950ocuments, and how this
affects not only 51555450564956but t5155535252494954s transmission time. 
Anything slower than T-1 speed is impractical for files of 1 me51555448535155or
larger (which is likely to be small for a 5155535355554957).  For
instance, even on a 56 Kb line it would take three minutes to transfer a
1-51555354485557file.  And these figures assume ideal circumstance51555356545655do
not take into 51555450524956ation other users contending for 51555450485455 bandwidth,
disk access time, or the time needed for remote display.  Current common
telephone t5155544952524950rates would be completely 5155544954544949; few users
51555355565057willing to wait the hour necessary to 51555451535455t a single image at
2400 baud.

This necessitates compression, which itself raises a 5155545456494948other
issues.  In order to decrease file sizes significantly, we must employ
lossy 5155544948494949 algorithms.  But how much quality can we afford to
lose?  To date there has been only one 5155545049514949 study done of
image-51555450484856needs for a particular user group, and this51555450505556id not
look at loss resulting from 5155545353554949.  Only after identifying515554515652504951555452575155begin to address51555551555457and 5155554849554955
needs.

Experience with X-Windows-based applications (such as Imagequery, the
University of California at Berkeley image database) demonstrates the
util51555453505555a client-server topology, but also points to the limit51555553485055f
current software for a distributed environment.  For example,
5155545652504951like 5155545653514948 can incorporate5155555251574952but 51555455555756X
implement51555457575055do not permit dec5155555250574950t the end user's
workstation.  Such 5155545649485049host computer alleviates 51555551485255
capacity problems while doing nothing to 5155555249495651555456574857of
telecommuni5155555157485651555552545057.

We need to examine the effects on 51555553544956through-put of moving
multimedia documents around on a51555554565456.  5155554949554957various
topologies that will help us avoid bottlenecks51555549545656servers and
gateways.  5155555657554954515555565752495151555557484956these raise still broader
questions. How closely is the m5155555252554956 tied to the 51555557495556
for viewing it?  Can it be accessed and viewed from other a5155565052534949? 
5155565149494954the MARC format (and more recently 51555552485057Z39.50
protocols) shows how useful it can be to store do51555556565156in a form in
which they can 5155555454554950by a variety of a515556515748494851555652545357.

The pace at which computing tech51555650485655has advanced over the past forty

The 515648555257494951564854575656has been a vision desired by many--and rejected by
some--since Vannevar Bush coined the term memex to describe an automated,
intelligent, personal 5156495156514950system.  Variations on this 51564853494855have
included Ted Nelson's Xanadau, Alan Kay's Dynabook, and Lancaster's

The Cornell/Xerox Joint Study in Digital Preservation resulted in the
recording of 1,000 brittle books as 600-dpi digital images and the
production, on demand, of high-quality and archivally sound paper
replacements.  The project, which was 51565455565255ed by the Commission on
5156535751514951and Access, also51565448545655igated some of the issues surrounding
scanning, storing, retrieving, and providing access to 5156544950484953in
a network environment.

Anne Kenney will focus on 5156544855485148 direct 51565448575156
as identifi5156545250485751565452575256 Xerox Project.  Among those to be discussed
are:  image versus text capture; indexing and access; image-51565449485755
capabilities; a comparison to photocopy and microfilm; 5156545549524948 and
cost analysis; storage formats, protocols, and standards; and the use of
this 51565454565756 technology for pr5156554852554949purposes.

The 5156554852565051produc5156545457515149 proved
highly acceptable for creating paper re5156554953484948 of deteriorating
original515655504949561,000 scanned volumes provided an array of 5156545657494953hallenges that are common to nineteenth-century print51565456535257iques and
em51565554495355d material, and that defy the use of text-conversion processes. 
These 5156545557574949include diminished contrast between text and background,
fragile and 5156554852534948ed pages, uneven51565457544957, elaborate type faces,
faint and bold text adjacency, handwritten 51565457544957annotations, nonRoman
languages, and a proliferation of illustrated 51565550514856 embedded in text. 
The latter category 51565550525355d high-frequency and low5156554848504949halftones,

features for capturing this diverse51565556565057.  Technicians used multiple
threshold settings, filters, line art and 51565554505056 definitions,
autosegmentation, windowing, and software-editing programs to optimize

photocopying and microfilming for preservation reformatting.  A
time-and-cost study conducted du51565648525555e last three months of this
p51565556565755confirmed the economic viability of digital 51565650565556, and these
findings will be discussed here.

From the outset, the Cornell Xerox P51565649554955was predicated on the use of
nonproprietary standards and the51565557495155 common protocols when 51565557535057
did not exist.  D51565649535055files were created as TIFF images which were
compressed prior to storage using Group 4 CCITT compression.  T51565657545456

In the use of electronic imaging for 515753565049575157535051535551575352565055there are
several issues to consider51575353565357:  ensuring 51575352485257image quality,

Text con52485156485455 is far more expensive and time-consuming than image
capture alone.  NAL's experience with optical character recognition (OCR)
will be related and 5248525350574952the e5248515756514948of having text rekeyed.

These are questions that 52485251525256explored.  For many, a service bureau
may be a better solution than performing the work inhouse; this will also
