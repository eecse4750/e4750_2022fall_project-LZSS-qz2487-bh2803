  So spake th' apostate Angel, th5651535353in pain, 
Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; 
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- 
  "O Pri5649515653O Chief of many 5654525754d Powers 5652565154led th' embattled Seraphim to war

But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now 
Of 5750535654believe al5654495554, since no less 
Than such could have o'erpowered such 5652515354as ours)

To undergo5656485057punishment?" 
  Whereto w5755485453peedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:-- 
"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is misera5754535153
Doing or 5751545554ing: bu57505457535756545553be sure-- 
To do aught good never will be our task,

Whom we resist. If then his providence 
O5750564854our evil seek to bring forth good, 
Our labour must be to pervert that end, 
And ou57564949535752515153still to find means of evil; 
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps 
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb 
His inmost counsels from their destined aim. 5755524853see!494848525354ngry Victor hath recalled 5752565453minister5754494953vengeance and pursuit 
Bac5755555053the gate5754575753Heaven: the sulphurous hail, 
Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid 
The fiery surge that 5755565256 precipice 
O5755484856 received us falling; and the thunder, 
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, 
P4948485749555757555553spent his shafts494849485554ceases now 
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. 
Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn 
Or satiate fury yield i494849495755our Foe. 
Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, 
The seat of desolation, void of 494856545056Save what the glimmering of these livid flames 
Casts pal494853555054dreadful? Thither let us tend 
From off the toss49484953484951494853574954waves; 
There rest, if any rest can harbour there; 
And, re-assembling our afflicted powers, 
Consult how we may henceforth most offend 
Our enemy, our own loss how repair, 
How overcome this dire calamity, 
What reinforcement 494852504955gain from hope, 
If not, what resolution494951535754despair." 
  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, 
With head uplift above the wave494949555154eyes 
That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides 
Prone on the flood, extended lon494952485754large, 
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge 
As wh494954505355fables name of monstrous size, 
Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, 
Briareos or Typhon, wh494856485555den 
By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast 
Leviathan, which God of all his works 
Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream. 
Him, haply slumb494955525455494950495354Norway foam,

Moors by his side under the lee, while494949574954 
Invests the sea494955485054wished morn delays. 
So stretched out494954525454in length the Arch-fiend lay, 
Chain494954525454the burning lake; nor ever thence 
Had risen, or heaved his head, bu494954535155the will 
And high permission 494955535554-ruling Heaven

  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool 
His mighty stature; on each hand the flames 
Driven backward slope their pointing spire495049485154,rolled 
In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale. 
Then with expanded wings he steers his fl495054565554Aloft, incumbent495057505256dusky air495052565556felt unusual weight; till on dry land 
He lights--if it were495048485154that ever burned 
With solid, a495057545154lake495055485654liquid fire, 
And such appeared in hue as when the force

Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side 
Of thundering Etna, whose combustible

  "Is this the region, 495054495457soil, the clime," 
S495057545755495151555054lost Archangel, "49505549564948eat 
That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom 
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he 
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid 
What shall be right: farthest from him is best 
Whom reason hath equalled, 495154575354hath made supreme 
Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields, 
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,

  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub 
Thus answered:--"Leader of those armies bright 
Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!

  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend 
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, 
Ethereal temper, massy, large495257575454round, 
Behi495350545455cast. The broad circumference 
Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb 
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views

Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands, 
Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe. 
His spear--to equal which the tallest pine

And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown, 
Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood, 
Under amazement of 495357505554hideous change. 
He 495452485255so loud that all the hollow deep 
Of Hell resounded:--"Princes, Potentates, 
Warriors, the Flower of 495455565054--once yours; now 495449544854
If such astonishment as this can seize 
Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place

Yet to their General's voice 495549505054oon obeyed

To his grim idol. Hi504851554854Ammonite 
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain, 
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream 
Of utmost Arnon. Nor content504848545654such 
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart 
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build504850514954temple right against the 495755535655504853544854 
On that opprobrious hill504853535054made 504848575354ove 
The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence 
And black Gehenna calle504848564955type of Hell.

Peor his other name, when he enticed

To do him wanton rites, which co504855505754m woe. 
Y50485454484948his lustful orgies he enlarged 
Even to that hill of scandal, by the 504856535555Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate, 
Till good Josiah drove them 504857545055to 504857515455With these came they who, from the bordering flood 
Of old Euphrates504951575656brook that parts 
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names 
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those ma504857564854hese feminine. For Spirits, when they please, 
Can either sex assume, or both; so soft 
And uncompounded is their essence pure, 
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb, 
Nor f504856525655504951565054 brittle strength of bones, 
Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose, 
Dilated or condensed, bright or obsc504948565454Can execute504954545355airy purpose504956484956works of love or enmity fulfil. 
For 504951565354the race of 504956525755oft forsook 
Their Living S504950555455, and unfrequented left 
His righteous altar, bowing lowly down 
To bestial gods; for505048515155505048575154heads as low 
Bowed down in battle, sunk befor504951565154spear 
Of despicable foes. 50504850544949in troop 
Came Astoreth, who505048554854Phoenicians called 
Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns; 
To whose 504955575155image nigntly by the moon 
Sidonian virgins paid505048574955vows and songs; 
In Sion also not unsung, where stood 
Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built 
By that uxorious king 504955495154heart, though large, 
Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell 
To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, 
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured 
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate 
In amorous ditties all a summer's day, 
While smooth Adonis from his native rock 
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood 
Of 505048555156yearly wounded: the love-tale 
Infected Sion's daughters505052575354like heat, 505050485655wanton passions in the sacred proch 
Ezekiel saw, when, b505054485154vision led, 
His eye surveyed the dark 505052565555ies 
Of alienated Judah. Next came one 
Who mourned in earnest505050495754 the captive ark 
Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off, 
In his own 505057485054, on the grunsel-edge, 
Where he fell flat505148535154ham505051535155worshippers: 
Dagon 505055535554me, sea-monster,upward man 
And downward fish; yet had his 505150484955high 
Rear505054494954Azotus, dreaded through the coast 
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, 
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. 
Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat 
Was505152545054Damascus, 505056545655fertile bank505148535654Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. 
He also against the house of God was bold: 
A leper once he lost, and gained a king-- 
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew 
God's altar to disparage and displace 
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn505153575554odious offerings, and adore the gods 
Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared 
A crew who, under names of old renown-- 
Osiris, Isis, Oru505148555255their train-- 
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused 
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek 
Their wandering505150575554disguis505248555354brutish forms 
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape 
Th' infecti505156505054en505151545755borrowed gold composed 
The calf in Oreb; 505152554855 rebel king 
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan, 
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox-- 
Jehovah, who, in one night505153495355he pas505154565554rom 505154575254marching, equalled with one stroke 
Both her first-bor505252484854all her bleati505156494955. 
Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd 
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love 
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood 
Or 505252525054smoked; yet who505155505554oft than he 
In temple505250555654at altars, 505249525456505250565255 
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled 505252535554lus505252495654violence the house of God? 
In courts and palaces he also reigns, 
A505251515154luxurious cities505256535255 the noise 
Of riot ascends above 505255545154loftiest towers, 505157554855jury and outrage; and505254545355night 
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons 
Of 505253485154, flown with inso505250545454and wine. 
Witness t50524950484948 of Sodom, and that 505249575155In Gibe505256505154505252575555hospitable door 
Ex505348495454a matron, to avoid worse rape.

Th' Ionian gods--of Javan's issue held 
Gods, yet confessed later than 505349484954 and Earth, 
Their boasted parents;--Titan, 505350484954's 50535150524948, 
With his enormous brood505255535554birthright seized 
By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove, 
His own and Rhea505350555454, like measure found; 
So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete505351505654Ida known505350485654ce on505350525054nowy top 
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air505257535657highest heaven; or505255525756Delphian cliff, 
Or in Dodona505351545156rough all the bound505352565754Doric land; or who with 505348565054 old 
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian field505356514856o'er the Celtic roame505348535254utmost Isles. 
  A505348485554se and more came flocking; but505356485654looks 
Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared 
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have505352564854 their Chief 
Not in despair, 50534856504955mselves not lost 
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast 
Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride 
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore 
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised 
Their fainting courage505449525654dispelle505353564956fears. 
Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound 
Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upr505356515355His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed 
Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall: 
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurl505356495054' imperial ensign505448514855, full high advanced, 
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind, 
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed, 
Seraphic ar505355514955trophies; 505454565256while 
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds: 
At which the universal host up-sent 
A shout that tore Hell's concave505451555054beyond 
Fright505456534855reign of Chaos and old Night. 
All in a moment through 505451485554oom were seen 
Ten thousand banners rise int505450575454air, 505451485454orient colours waving: with them rose 
A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms 
Appeared, and serried shields in thick array 
Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move 
In perfect phalanx505455494856Dorian moo505548485254flute505455525154soft recorders--such as 505549575557o height of noblest temper heroes old

Breathing united force505550495454fix50545554524948, 
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed 
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now 
Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front 
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise 
Of warriors old, with ordered spear505554524854hield, 
Awaiting what comm505555515254eir mighty Chief

Glories: for never, since created Man, 
Met such embodie505556564856as, named with these, 
Could merit more than505557504854small infantry 
Warr505648485054by cranes--though all the giant brood 
Of Phlegra505552565756' heroic race were joined 
That fought at Thebe505555575554Ilium, on each side 
Mixed with auxiliar 505556554954and what resounds 
In fable or romance of Uther's son, 
Begirt with British and Armoric knights; 
And all who505557555354, baptized or infidel, 
Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,

Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore 
When Charlemain 505648515154ll his peerage fell 
By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond 
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed 
Their dread Commander. He, above the rest 
In shape and gesture proudly eminent, 
Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost 
All her original brightness, nor appeared 
Less505655555154Archangel ruined, and th' excess 
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen 
Looks through the horizontal misty air 
Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon, 
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds 
On half the nations, and with fear of 505653505754 
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so505656485554shone

Deep scars of thunder had intrench505655555756care 
Sat on 505652575754ded cheek, but 505653495354brows 
Of dauntless courage505653545055onsiderate pride 
Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast 
Signs of remorse and passion, to behol505751515454 fellows 505748535455crime, the followers rather 
(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned 
For ever now to ha505753514954ir lot in pain-- 
Millions of Spirits for505749524955ult amerced 
Of Heaven, and from eteranl splendours flung 
For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood, 
505756555754505754555054withered; as, when heaven's fire 
Hath scathe505754535554forest oaks or mountain pines, 
With singed top 505750525254stately growth, though bare, 
Stands o505757525654blasted heath. He now prepared 
To speak; whereat 505752525254doubled ranks they bend

Millions of flaming s514950565655drawn514957565154the thighs 
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze 
Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged 
Against the Highest515048515454fierce with grasped arms

Hurling defiance toward the vault 51504956544950  515051545054stood a hill not far, whose grisly top 
Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire 
Shone514956515054a glossy scurf--undoubted sign 
That in 515049485754mb was hid metallic ore, 
The work of sulphur. 515053575557winged with speed, 
A numerous brigade hastened: as when band515050565554pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed, 
Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field, 
Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on-- 
Mammon, the least erected 515057495254 that fell 
From 515052505254; for even in 515052545254 his looks and 51505755524948Were always downward bent, admiring more 
The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold, 
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed 
In vision beatific. By him first

Opened into the hill a spacious wound, 
And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire 
That 515056505355grow515057505554ll; that soil may best 
Deserve the precious bane. And here let those 
Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell

Of starry lamp515255524954blazing cressets, fed 515254575254naptha and asphaltus, yielded light 
As from a sky. The hasty multitude 
Admiring entered; and the work some praise, 
And some 515252535156itect. His hand was known

Exalted to such power515351545554gave to rule, 
Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright. 
Nor was his name unheard or unadored 
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land 
Men called him Mulciber515257545754how he fell

Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room

Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves, 
Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side 
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees, 
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon 
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth 
Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance

At once 515455544955y and fear his heart rebounds.

Book II         5155505055565155505349495451555056545053
 
  
High on a throne of royal state, which far 
Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind515649555654where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, 
Satan exalted sat, by merit raised 
To that bad eminence; and, from despair 515650574854high uplifted beyond hope, aspires 
B515553565354th515554504855, insatiate to pursue 
Vain w515650575355 Heaven515555525155by success untaught, 
His proud imaginations thus displayed:-- 
  "P515557575154and Dominions, Deities of 515556524954!-- 
For, since no deep515653575155 her gulf can hold 
Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen, 
I give not 515648545754 for lost:515650494854this descent 
Celestial Virtues rising will appear 
More glorious and more dread than from no fall515657575455trust 51565756574948 to fear no second fate!-- 
Me though just right, and the fixed law51565156544949, 
Did first create your leader--next, free choice 
With what besides in council or in fight 
Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss, 515656565054far at least recovered, hath much more 
Established in a safe, unenvied 515750565154, 
Yielded with full consent. The happier state 
In 515654495756which follows dignity, might draw 
Envy from each inferior; but who here 
Will envy whom the highest place exposes 
Foremost to stand again515657575454 Thunderer's aim 
Your bulwark515748485554condemns to greatest share 
Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good 
For515656545555to strive, no strife can grow up 515655495154
From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell 
Precedence; none whose portion is so small 
Of present pain that with ambitious mind 515749535054covet more! With this advantage, 515748544954
To union515754525354firm faith51565655544949accord, 515756515154than can be515748575054515752535455e now return

Surer to prosper than 515657575155ity 
Could have assured us; and by wh515757505254t way, 
Whether of open war or covert guile, 
W515750525654debate. Who can advise may speak." 
  He ceased515750525454next him Moloch, sceptred king, 
Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit 
That fought 51575355494949now 515750565654r by despair. 
His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed 
Equal in streng515755575756rather than be less 
Cared not to be at all; 515752555655at care lost 
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse, 
He reck515753525754524851575654these words thereafter spake:-- 
  "My sentence is for 515757575256. Of wiles524850485456unexpert, I boast not: them let those 
Contrive who need515755554954hen they need; not now. 
For, while515754555354sit contriving, shall the rest-- 
Millions that stand in arms, and longing wa524850515754e sig524849565155ascend--sit lingering here, 
Heaven's fugitive515756555055for their dwelling-place 
Accept524856534954dark opprobrious den of shame, 
The prison of his ryranny who reigns 
By our delay? No! let us 524853505655choose, 
Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once 
O'er 524850505257high towers to force resistless 524948525354Turning our tortures into horrid arms 
Against the T524849515354r; when, to meet the noise 
O524851565154almighty engine, he shall hear 
Infe524948535354hunder, and, for lightning, see 
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage 
Among his Angel524856515255his throne itself 
Mix524854535156Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, 
His own invented torments. But perhaps 
The way seems difficul524951535555steep to scale 
With upright wing ag524856495354a higher foe! 
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench 
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still, 
That in our porper motion we ascend 
Up to our native seat; descent and fall 
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, 
When the fierce foe hung o524856525054broken rear 
Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep, 
With what compulsion and laborious flight 
We sunk thus low? Th'524948555454t is easy, then; 
Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke 
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find 
To our destruction524952525456re be in Hell 
Fear to be 524948565254destroyed! What can 524948544857
Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned 
In this abhorred deep to utter woe! 
Where pain of unextinguishabl524957564854 
Must exercise us without hope of end 
The vassals of his a524953515754wh524955565455scourge 
Inexorably, and the torturing hour, 
Calls us to penance? Mor52495449554949 than thus, 
We s524955575554be quite abolished525051495254expire. 
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense 
His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged, 
Will either524954495255consume us, and reduce 
To nothing this essential--happier far 
Than miserable to have eternal being!-- 
Or, if our substance525050525254deed divine, 
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst 
O525050535255side524956535656; and by proof we feel525053505754power sufficient to disturb his Heaven, 
And with perpetual inroads to alarm, 
Though inaccessible, his fatal throne: 
Which, if not victory, is yet revenge." 
  He ended frowning525053524854his look denounced 
Desperate 525048485055525054505454battle dangerous 
To less525054505454gods. On th' other side up rose 
Belial, in act more graceful525049564854umane. 
A fairer person lost not 525052485454; he seemed 
For dignity compose525056555355high exploit. 
But all was false and hollow; though his tongue 
Dropped manna525149525254could make the worse appe525057495654e better reason, to perplex and dash 
Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low-- 
 To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds 
Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear52514855534953suasive accent thus began:-- 
  "I should be much for open war, O Peers, 
As not behind in hate, if what was urged

Did not dis525054505354me most525151495154seem to cast 
Ominous conjecture on the whole success; 
When 525054575554 most excels in fact of arms, 
In what he 525149535756 and in what 525056484855

Is flat d525250485154: we must exasperate 
Th' Almighty 525154505754 to spend a525250554955rage; 
And that 525154525454nd us; 52515449494948be our cure-- 
To be no more. Sad cure! for who 525157575454lose, 
Though full of pain, this intellectual being525155534954se thoughts that wander through eternity, 
To perish rather, swallowed up and lost 
In the wide womb of uncreated 525253544856Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, 
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe 
Can give it, or will ever? How he can 
Is doubtful525251525655he never525248515054is sure. 
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his 525254515754Belike525251554857impotence or unaware, 
To give his enemies their wish525348554954end 
Them in his anger whom 52524954534948saves 
To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?' 
Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed, 
Reserve525349575155destined to eternal woe; 
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, 
What52525155544953worse?' Is this525253524954, worst--

The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed 
A refuge from those wounds. Or wh525255555154lay 
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse. 
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, 
Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, 
And plunge 525349515354the flames; or from above

Of Hell 525349554955spout her cataracts of fire, 
Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall 
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, 
Designing or exhorting glorious war, 
Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled, 
Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey 
Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk 
Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains, 
There to converse with everlasting groans, 
Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, 
Ages of hopeless end525450515055would be wo525449535255ar, therefore, open or concealed, alike 
My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile 525453514854him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye 
Views all things at one view? He525453565254Heaven's height 
All these our motions vain sees and derides, 
Not more almighty to resist our m525355554854Than wise to frustrate all our plot525356495454wiles. 
Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven 
Thus trampled, thus expel525356515054o suffer here

By my advice; since fate inevitable 
Subdues us525457535554omnipotent decree, 
The Victor's will. T525449525556, as to do, 
Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust

And venturous, if that fail them, shrink525453575454fear

Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain525455535455senten525457545254their Conqueror525455505055is now 
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, 
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit 
His anger, and perhaps, thus far remo525457554854Not mind us not offe525457554955satisfied 
With what is punished; whence 525553575454raging fires 
Will slacken, if his breath stir not 525457525154flames. 
Our purer essen525455564854n will overcome 
Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; 
Or, changed at length525554504854to the place conformed 
In temper and in nature, will receive 
Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of 525552505157is horror525549495154grow mild, this darkness light; 
Besides what hope the never-525556485354 flight

Worth waiting--since our present lot appears 
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst525649545657procure not to ourselves more woe." 
  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb, 
Counselled ignoble ease 525557575754aceful sloth525648485555peace; and after him525648555554Mammon spake:-- 
  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven 
We war, if war be best, or to regain 
Our own right lost. Him to un525553505455we then 
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield 
To fickle C525557565655and Chaos judge the strife. 
The former, vain to 525554545554argues as525553575654
The latter; for what 525652495155an be for us 
Within 525557485254's bound, unless 525554555757Lord supreme

Ambrosial odours525655575654525648554857flowers, 
Our servile offerings? This must be our task 
I525653575656, this our delight. How wearisome 
Eternity so spent in worship pai525656565354whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, 
By force impossible, by leave obtained 
Unacceptable, though in 525652564856our state 
Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek 
525751494856good from ourselve525656535355525652494856 own

Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst 
Thick clouds and dark doth 525754504854's all-ruling Sire 
Choose to reside, his glory unobscured, 
And with the majesty of 525749495557round 
Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar. 
Mustering their rage525755494854525757574854 resembles Hell! 
As h534848544954525751555056, cannot we his light 
Imitate when we please? 525753484955sert soil

Nor want we skill or art 52575255494950to raise 
Magnificence; and what can 525753485355show more? 
Our torments also may, in length of time, 
Becom525754494854elements, these piercing fires 
As soft as now severe, our temper changed 
Into 525756505454525752545254; which must needs remove 
The sensible 534850505255. All 534851565755invite 
To peaceful counsels534851565254the settled state 
Of order, how in safety best we may 
Compos534849495654present evils, with regar534852545254what we are and where, dismissing quite 
525756545054oughts of war. Ye have534855505254I advise." 
  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled 
Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain 534849544954ound of bl534854515657winds, which all night long 
Had rouse534850505156a, now with hoarse cadence lull 
Seafaring men o'erwatch534849515754ose bark by chance 
Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay 
After the tempest. Such applause was heard 
As Mammon ended, and his sentence 534948515154d, 
Advising peace: for such another field 
They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear 
Of thunder 534856535257word of Michael 
Wrought still within them534950505154no less desire 
To found this nether empire534855524956might rise, 
By policy and long process 53495153524948In emulation opposite to Heaven. 
Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom, 
Satan except, none higher sat--with grave 
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed 
A pillar of state. Deep o534853565254front engraven 
Deliberation sat534948565654public care; 
And princely counsel 534855525255face yet shone, 
Majestic, 534954504954 in ruin. Sage he stood 
With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear 
The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look 
Drew audience and atten534948495054till as 534955534954
Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:-- 
  "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of 534952515554, 
Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now 
Must we renoun534957544854d, changing style, be called 
Princes of Hell?534957515054o the popular vote 
Inclines--here to continue535048564854build up here 
A growing 534957504854; doubtless! 534952485554we dream, 
And know not that the K53495251504951 hath doomed 
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat 
Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt 
From535049565155's high jurisdiction, in new league 
Banded against his throne, but to remain 
In strictest bondage535049505057thus far removed, 
Under th' inevitable curb, reserved 
His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, 
In he535050545754r depth, 535050514954first and last will reign 
Sole king535053515254of his kingdom lose no part

Us here, as with his golden those in 535053485054. 
What sit we then projecting peace and war? 
War 535051525454etermined u535054565454foile534957515655loss 
Irreparable; terms of 534957485554yet none 
Vouchsafed or sought; for what 535048484954will be given 
To us enslaved, but custody severe, 
And stripe535049484854arbitrary punishment 
Inflicted? and w53504948514948can we return, 
But, to our power, hostility and hate, 
Untamed reluctanc535148545055reven53505555574949slow, 
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least 
May reap his conquest535055545354may 535050485654rejoice 
In doing what we most in suffering feel? 
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need 
With dangerous expedition to invade 
Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, 
Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find 
Some easier enterprise? There is a place 
(If ancient and prophetic fame53515053484948 
Err not)--another World, the happy seat 
Of some new race, called Man, about this time 
To be created like to us535149495557less 
In power and excellence, but favoured more 
Of him who rules above; so was his will 
Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath 
That shook535148505355's whole circumference confirmed. 
Thither let us bend all our 535153535654ts, to learn 
What creatures t535150565454nhabit, of what mould 
Or subst535155505154how endued, 535156525557their535150515555
And where 535057545454weakness: how attempted best, 
By force of subtlety. Though 535153525055be shut, 
And 535151495057high Arbitrator sit secure 
In his own strength, this 535155534854may lie exposed, 
The utmost border of his kingdom, left 
To 535152484854defence who hold it: here, perhaps, 535248485254advantageous act may be achieved 
By sudden onset--either with Hell-fir535157565654waste535156575254535156514954reation, or possess 
All as our own535157535054drive, as we were driven, 
The puny habitants; or, if not535152544856
Seduce them to our party, th535157544857God 
May prove535248485055foe, and with repenting hand 
Abolish535157525057works. This would surpass 
Common revenge535251565454interrupt his joy 
In our confusion, and our joy uprais53524955484948disturbance; whe535154545255arling sons, 
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse 
Their frail original535255524854faded bliss-- 
Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth 
A535254505054ing, or to sit in darkness here 
Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub 
Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised 
By Satan535250575656 part proposed: for whence, 
But from the author of all ill, could spring 
So deep a malice, to confound the race 
Of mankind in one root, and Earth 535257484957 
To mingle 535254534854volve, done all to spite 
The great Creator? But 535349535454535250484854still serves 
His glory to augment. The bold design 
Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy 
Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent 
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:-- 
"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, 
Synod of God535253574854, like to what ye are, 
Great things resolved, which 535348485157lowest deep 
Will once more lift us up, in 535257525054of fate, 
Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view 
Of 535257535254bright confines, 535350565556with neighbouring arms, 
And opportune excursion, we may chance 
Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone 
Dwell, not unvisited of 535256495754's fair light, 
Secure, and at th535348484856ening orient beam 
Purge off th535352574954om: the soft delicious air, 
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires, 
Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send 
In search of this new World? 53534853574952find 
Sufficient? who535349495655tempt with wandering fee535356505154 dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss535353545455through the palpable obscure535350545754out 
His uncouth way, or spread his airy f535354485656Upborne with indefatigable wings 
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive 
The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then 535354495655e, or what evasion bear him safe, 
T53535449524949strict senteries and stations thick 
Of Angels watching round? He535354504954had need 
All circumspection: and we now no less 
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom 535448575757The weight of all535451505254our last hope, relies." 
  This said, he sat; and expectation held 
His look suspense, awaiting who appeared 
To second, or oppose, or undertak535449525355perilous attempt. But all sat mute, 
Pond535452525554the danger with deep thoughts535357554955ach 
In other's countenance 535452555257own dismay, 
Astonished. None amon535357555354choice and prime 
Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found 
So hardy as to proffer or accept, 
Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last, 
Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised 
Above his fellows, with monarchal pride 
Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:-- 
  "O Progeny of 535452524954! Empyreal Thrones! 
With reason hat535454535055silence and demur 
Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way 
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light. 
Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, 
Outrageous to devour, immures us round 
Ninefold535550525454gates of burning adamant, 
Barred over us, prohibit all egress. 
These passed, if any pass535548545254void prof535549524854Of unessential Night receives him next, 
Wide-gaping, and with utter los535455575254eing 
Threatens him, plunged in535548494854abortive gulf. 
If thence he scape, into whatever world, 
Or unknown region, what remain535457504954less 
Than535456485757535555555754s, and as hard escape? 
But I should ill become this throne, O Peers, 
And this imperial sovereignty, adorned 
With splendour, arme535550495655power535551514954ught propo535556495354nd judged of public moment in the shape 
Of difficulty or 535550505754, could deter 
Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume 535554514955royalties535553545154not refuse to reign, 
Refusing to accept as great a share 
Of hazard as of honour, due alike 
To him wh535550564855535554495255so much to him due 53555148524949more as he above the rest 
High535551545655ed sits? Go, the535553505654, mighty Powers, 
Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home, 
While here shall be our535552495355what best may ease 
The present misery, and render Hell 
More tolerable; if there be cure or charm 
To respite, or d535652525554, or slack the pain 
Of 535650504854ll mansion: intermit no watch 
Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad 
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek 
Deliverance for us all. This enterprise 
None535648525155partake535653514954me." Thus saying, ro535648565656Monarch535655525254prevented all reply; 
Prudent lest, from his resolution raised, 
Others among the chief535652495354 offer now, 
Certain to be 535654565354d, what erst they feared, 
And, so 535557555057535648495754in opinion stand 
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute 
Which he th535652495454535656575455huge must earn. But535649565754
Dreade535748515554more th' adventure than his voice 
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose. 
Their rising all 535650495057as as the sound 
Of thunder heard remote. Towards h535651495556bend 
With awful reverence prone535748575654as a God 
Extol him equal to the Highest in 535751485454. 
Nor failed they to express how much they praised 
That for the general safety he despised 
His own: for neither d535653555254Spirits damned 
Lose 535751485355ir virtue; lest bad men should boast535656545656specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, 
Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. 
 535752565054535656574954heir doubtful consultations dark 
Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief: 
As, when from mountain-top535750545654dusky clouds 
Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread 
Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element 
Scowls535749485154the darkened landscape snow or shower, 
If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet, 
Extend his evening beam535749494854fields revive, 
The birds 535753505254notes renew535755544954bleating herds 
Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. 
O shame to men! Devil with devil 535755564956Firm concord holds; men only disagree 
Of creatures rational, though 544849565755ope 
Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace, 
Yet live in hatred, enmity544850574954strife 
Among themselves, and levy cruel wars 
Wasting the 544849535255each other to destroy: 
As if (544850505054might induce us to accord) 
Man had not hellish foes enow besides, 
That day and night for his destruction wait! 
  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth 
In order came the grand infernal Peers: 
Midst 535754515456ir mighty Paramount535757554855eemed 
Alone th' antagonist of 544853505654, nor less 
Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, 
And god-like imitated state: him round 
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed 
With bright emblazonry544854515454horrent arms.

Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms

In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds544955485055ld uproar:--544953545657 Alcides, from Oechalia crowned 544954575054conquest, fel544956495654envenomed robe545050525654tore

544955485054song was partial; but the harmony 
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) 
Suspended Hell545049505556ok with ravishment 
The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet 
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) 
545054484854 apart sat on a hill retired, 
In thoughts more elevate545054534855easoned high 
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Wi545049535556Fate-- 
Fixed fate, free will, f54504849534950 absolute, 
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost. 
Of good and evil much they argued then, 
Of happines545148565454final misery, 
Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:

Pain for a while or anguish545150555354excite 
Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast 
With stubborn patience as with triple steel. 
Another part, in squadrons and gross bands, 
On bold adventure to discover wide 
That dismal world, if any clime perhaps 
Might yield them easier habitation, bend 
Four ways their flying march, along the banks 
Of four infernal rivers, th545055525354gorge 
Into the burning lake their baleful streams-- 
Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; 
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; 
Cocytus, named of lamentation loud 
Heard on the rue54505751554948; fierce Phlegeton, 
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame545153495654rage. 
Far off from these, a slow545154535354ilent 545149545154, 
Lethe545149545554river of oblivion, rolls 
Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks 
Forthwith his former state and being forgets-- 
Forgets both jo545157565054grief, pleasure and pain. 
Beyond this flood a frozen continent 
Lies dar545153525154wild, beat with perpetual storm545155555454whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land 
Thaws not, but gathers heap545250525254ruin see545151535255ancient pile; all else deep sno545155485654ice, 
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog 
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, 
Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air 
Burns frore545154525654cold performs th' effect of fire. 
Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled, 
At certain revolutions all the damned 
Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change 
Of 545252525355extremes, 545154525756 by 545154574855more545253505455, 
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice 
Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine 
Immovable, infixed, and f545252545254round

Both to 545248484955, their sorrow to augment, 
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach 
The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose 
In sweet 545348515454fulness all pain545257555254oe, 
All in one mo545250515454and so near545253574954rink; 
But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt, 
Medusa with Gorg545348485654terror guards 
The for545254505455of itself the water flies 
All taste of living wight, as once it fled 
The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on 
In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous b545253575654
With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast, 
Viewed first545257535355lamentable lo545256495155found 
No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale 545349545354pass545350535456545253554855region dolorous, 
O'er 545254514855545351515454, 545253565356iery alp, 
Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death-- 
A universe 545254565356, which God by curse 
Created evil, for evil only good; 
Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, 
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, 
Obominable, inutter545256544854545354535054rse 
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived, 
545354535554545350495455Hydras545355565154Chimeras dire. 
  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, 
Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, 
Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell 
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes 
He scours the right hand coast, 54535049564948the left; 
Now shaves545450524954level wing the deep, then soars 
Up to the 545357505554concave tow545449544855igh. 
As when far off at sea a fleet descried 
Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds 
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles 
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring 
Their spicy drugs; they o545354505754trading flood, 
545453515356the wide Ethiopian 545356495155Cape, 
Ply stemming nightly 54544853574949pole: so seemed 
F545356575355the flying Fiend. At last appear 
Hell-bounds, high reaching t545448555554horrid roof, 
And thrice threefol54545150564949; three folds were brass, 
Three iron, three of adamantine rock, 
Impenetra545455515554mpaled with circling fire, 
Yet unconsumed. Before 54545449494948there sat 
On either side a formidable Shape. 
The one s545450515254wom54545149534948waist, and fair, 
But ended foul in many a scaly fold, 
Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed 
With mortal sting. About her middle round 
A cry 545548535255-hounds never-ceasing bark545449575157wide Cerberean mouths full loud545451535354rung 
A hideous peal; yet545457505054545456574854list, would creep, 
If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb545456505555kennel there; yet545455485056till 545452555755and howled 
Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these 
Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts 
Calabria from 545549544954arse Trinacrian shore; 
Nor uglier follow the night-hag545455554954, called 
In secret, riding thr545553495757air she comes, 
Lur545550565056the smell of infant blood, to dance 
With Lapland witches, whil545551555554labouring moon 
Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape-- 
If shape it might be545457495256that 545455515754had none 
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; 
Or substance 54545657525052dow 545555495054, 
For each545555525756545556485154--black it stood as Night, 
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell545553545155shook a dreadful dart: what s545557555554his head 
The likeness of a kingly crown had on. 
Satan was now at han545556575455from his seat 
The monster moving onward came as fast545648535155horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode. 
Th' undaunted Fiend what this 545554515557admired-- 
A545549575154, not feared (God545649495354is Son except, 
Created 545649484954naught valued he nor shunned)545650565755with disdainful look thus first began:-- 
  "Whence a545553495256art thou, execrable Shape, 
That dar'st, though grim and 545557484956, advance 
Thy miscreated front athwart my way 
To yonder gates? Th545652515257m I mean to pass, 
That be assured, without leave asked of thee. 
Retire; or taste thy folly545649505054learn by proof, 
Hell-born545648495654to contend with Spirits of Heaven." 
  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:-- 
"A545648535455545655485354traitor Angel? 545649495256 he,

So spea545655515557so threatening, grew tenfold, 
More dreadful and deform. On th' other side, 
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood 
Unterrifi545749484956like a comet burned, 
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge 
In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair 
Shakes pestilence and war. Each a545753564954head 
Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands 
No second545750565156intend545752485454such a frown 
Each cast at th545749565056as when two black clouds, 
With hea545757505154artillery fraught, came rattling on 
Over the Caspian,--then st545750534955nt to 545657565554
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow 
To join 545751485054dark encounter in mid-air. 
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell 
Grew darker at their frown; so match545750505354y stood; 
For never but once more was wither like 
To meet so great a foe. And now 545750545154deeds 
Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, 
Had no545756555554snaky Sorceress, that sat 
Fast by Hell-gate and kep545757575154545757545054key, 
Risen554852485254with hideous outcry rushed between. 
  "O father, what 554848565654s thy hand," she cried, 
"Against thy only son? What fury, O son, 
Possess554852515054e to bend that mortal dart 
54575453504950545755495354's head? And know'st for whom?

At thee, ordain554853575356rudge to execute 
Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids-- 
H54575648554954one day will destroy ye both!" 
  She spake554850515554at her word554854525654hellish Pest 
Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:-- 
  "So strange thy outcry554852534954thy 554848515254so 545757555656
Thou interposest554854484855my sudden hand, 
Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by 554856485355What it554854515156, till first I know of thee 554849504854thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, 
In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st 
Me father, 554852534854at phantasm 554850525256my son. 
554851565055thee not, nor ever saw till now 
Sight more detestable than him 554854545054ee." 
  T' whom554853505754the Portress of 55495150534948replied:-- 
"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem 
Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair 
In Heaven, when at th' assembl554948515655in sight 
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined 
In bold conspiracy a554953525455554854555154's King,

In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast 
Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, 
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, 
Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed, 
Out554954525354554948525555I sprung. Amazement seized 
All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid

Becam'st enamoured554957565354such joy thou took'st 
With me in secret that my womb conceived 
A growing burden. Mean554956565254war arose, 
And fields were fought in 555049574954: wherein rema555049535154(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe 
Clear victory; 554952525155part los555050485154rout 
Through555051565457Empyrean. Down555048484954fell, 
Driven headlong from the pitch 555049485557, down 
Into this Deep554956575054in the general fall 
I also: at which time this powerful key 554954565554my hands was given, with charge to keep 
These gates for ever shut, 554955565054none can pass 
Without my 555054564855. Pensive here I sat 
Alone; but long 554955555754not, till555051485756, 
Pregnant by thee555054524854now excessive 555054494956Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. 
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest, 
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way, 
Tore th555052575754my entrails, that555051535055fear and pain 
Distorted, a555050555754nether shape thus grew 
Transformed: but he my inbred enemy 
Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, 
Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! 
Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed 
From all her caves, and back resounded 555051545156555051575754555056495554he pursued (though more, it seems, 
Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far, 
Me overtook, his mother555055554954dismayed, 
And, in embraces forcible and foul 
Engende555148495654ith me, of that rape begot555151505656yelling monster555148524855555152485555easeless cry 
Surround me, as 555150485454aw'st--hourly conceived 
And h555054495154bor555153555256sorrow infinite 
To me; for, when they list, into the womb 
That bred them they return, and howl555154494854gnaw 
My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth 
Afresh555153525755conscious terrors vex me round, 
That rest or intermission none I find. 
Before mine eyes in opposition sits 
Grim Death, my son 555151554954e, who set them on555152525654 me, his parent, would full soon devour 
For want of other prey, but that he knows

Should prove a bitter morsel555152575155is bane, 
Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced. 
But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun555151555354deadly arrow; neither vainly hope 
To be invulnerable in those bright arms, 
Through tempered heavenly; for555249525454mortal dint, 
Save he who reigns above, none can resist." 
  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore 
Soon learned, now milder, 555153485254us answered smooth:-- 
  "Dear daughter--since555252525254claim'st me 555155505654y sire,

Both him 555250525155e, and all the 555251565056 host 
Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, 
Fell with us from on high. From them I go 
This uncouth errand sole555256565754one for all 
Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread

To search555249555655wandering quest, a place foretold 
Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now 
Created vast and round--a555250574855of bliss

To know; and, this once known, shall soon return, 
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death 
Shall dwell at eas555350535755up555352545054own unseen

With odours. There ye 555256555254be fed and filled 
Immeasurably; all things 555256485157your prey." 
  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased555356485454555348535455Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear 
His famine sh555354515555555348545555555356505754blessed his maw 
Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced 
His mother bad555357495556us bespake her sire:-- 
  "The key of this infernal Pit, by due555353544955y command 555357485557's all-powerful King, 
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock 
These adamantine gates; against all force 
Death ready stands to interpose his dart, 
Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might. 
But what owe I to his 555353504855s above, 
Who hates m555448505355hath hither thrust me down 
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, 
To sit in hateful office here confined,

Here in perpetual agony and pain, 
With terrors and with clamours compassed round

Thou art my father, thou my author555354535155

But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon

The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign 
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems 
Thy daughter 555455555554y darling, without end." 
  Thus saying, from 555456545254de the fatal key, 
Sad instrume555452575554all our woe, she took; 
And, towards the gate rolling her bestial tr555453565054Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew, 
Which, but herself, no555548545354the Stygian Powers 
Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns

55565052555048 the wary Fiend 
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, 
Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith 
He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed 
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare 
Great things555657495154small) than when Bellona storms555651485255all her batt555652505254engines, bent to rase

The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans 
He spread for flight, and, 555749515354 surging smoke 
Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league, 
As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides 
Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets 
A vast vacuity. All unawares,

Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fa555751545754Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, 
Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.

And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
  T'564854555554Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers 
And Spirtis 564853545454s 56485655494954,

The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint 
Wand564948525554this darksome desert, as my way 
Lies 564951575056your spacious empire up to light, 
Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek, 
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds 
Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place, 
From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King 
Possesses late564950484954ither to arrive 
I travel this profound. Direct my course:

To your behoof, if I t564949515054gion 564949554854
All usurpation thence expelled, reduce 
To her original darkness and 564951565554way 
(Which is my present journey)564956575154once more 
Erect the standard there of 56495551544951. 
Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!" 
  Thus564957544954; and him thus the Anarch old, 
With faltering speech and visage incompose565049555754swered:  "I know thee, stranger, who thou art--  *** 
That mighty leading Angel564951485354of late 
Made head against 564957525754's King, though overthrown. 
I saw and heard; for such a numerous host 
Fled not in silence 565050575756the frighted Deep564955484956ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, 
Confus565050515454rse confounded564956535654565051515554-gates 
Poured out by millions her victorious bands, 
Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here 
Keep residence; if all I can will serve 
That little wh565051504855left so to defend, 
Encroached on still 564957555656our intestine broils 
Weakening the sceptre of old565052534954: first, Hell, 
Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; 
Now lately 565051535054 and Earth, another world 
Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain 
To that side565048485456from whence your legions fell! 
If that way be your walk, you have not far; 
So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed; 
Havoc565048545456oil565048565454565054575154are my gain." 
  He ceased565148574854Satan stay565056534955to reply, 
But, glad that now his sea should find a shore565057515556fresh alacrity and force renewed 
Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, 
Into the wild expanse56505351485456514956544950shock 
Of fighting elements, on all sides round 
Environed, wins his way; harder beset 
And more endangered than when Argo passed 
Th565152545654Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks, 
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned 
Charybdis565148504854by th' o565150515054hirlpool steered. 
So he with difficul565057545755labour hard 
Moved on, wi56505455535054e; 565149535454he once 565056575054, soon after, when Man fell, 
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, 
Following his track (such was t565150545454l of 565155514854) 
Paved after him a broad and beaten way 
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf 
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, 
From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb 
Of this frail World; by whi565157545455Spirits perverse 565156515754easy intercourse pass to and fro 
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom 
Go565151555254good Angels guard by special grace. 
  But now at last the sacred influence 
Of light appear565156535455from the walls o565154534956 
Shoots far int565250494954bosom of dim Night 
A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins 
Her farthest verge565249505454Chaos to retire, 
As from her ou565155555754works, a broken foe, 
With tumult less and with less hostile din; 
That Satan w565152565357toil565251575654now with ease, 
Waft565252565757calmer wave by dubious light, 
And, like a weather-565250564955vessel, holds 
Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; 
Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, 
Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold 
Far off th' empyreal 565254564954, extended wide 
In circuit, undetermined square or round, 565253555754opal towers565256495154attlements adorned 565252575654ving sapphire, once his native seat; 
And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, 
This pendent565256575554, in bigness as a star 
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon. 
Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, 
Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.

But yet all is not done; Man disobeying, 
Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins 
Against the high supremacy of Heaven, 
Affecting God-head, and, so losing all, 
To expiate his treason hath nought left, 
But to destruction sacred 575154544854vote, 
He, with his whole posterity, must die, 
Die he or justice must; unless for him

By doom severe, had no575256574854Son of God, 
In whom the fulness d575253485754of love divine,

No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all 
The multitude of Angels, with a shout 
Loud as from 49484849505656without number, sweet 
A575753574955blest voices, uttering joy, 49484849525255rung 
With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled 
The eternal regions:  Lowly reverent

With solemn adoration down they cast 
Their crowns inwove49484848564855marant and gold; 
Immortal 575756525655, a flower which once 
In Paradise, fast by the tree of life, 
Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence 
To49484850565657emoved, where first it grew, there grows, 
And flowers aloft shading the fount 4948484955494948And where the river of bliss through midst of 49484853555155
Rolls o'er Elysian 49484850505156her amber stream; 
With these that never fade the Spirits elect

Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright 
Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, 
Impurple49484852535455celestial roses smiled. 
Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took, 
Harps ever tuned49484853564955gli49484951504956by their side

Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, 
In whose conspicuous countenance, without 49484954495155Made visible, the Almighty Father shines, 
Whom else no creature can behold; on thee 
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides, 
Transfused 49484953495356his ample Spirit rests. 
He49485050565555 of Heavens and all the Powers therein 
By thee created; and b49484953555055threw down 
The aspiring Dominations:  Thou that day 
Th49484957484956's dreadful thunder didst not spare, 
Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels49485050575155shook 
Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks 
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed. 
Back from pursuit thy 49485049515555with loud acclaim 
Thee only extolled, Son4948505648485649485049534857might, 
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, 
Not so on Man:  Him 49485057535256their malice fallen, 
49485054535055of mercy and grace, thou4948505248554949doom 
So strictly, but much more to pity incline: 
No sooner did thy dear and only Son 
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man4948505149545252d, 
He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife 
O4948505349484950justice in thy face discerned, 
Regardless of the bliss w49485149504955he sat 
Second to thee, offered himself to die 
For Man's offence.  O unexampled love, 
Love no where to be found less than Divine! 
Hail49485148545157God, Saviour of Men!  Thy name 
Shall be the copious matter of my song 
Hencefor49485056555356never shall my heart thy praise 
Forget, nor from 494851515350495149485054535455disjoin. 
Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere, 
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent. 
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe 
Of this round world, whose first convex divides 
The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed 
From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old, 
Satan alighted walks:  A49485148565755far off 
It seemed, now seems a boundless continent 
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night 
Starless exposed49485156555455ver-threatening storms 
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky; 
Save on that side which 49485154575255e wall of 49485154564956
Though distant far, some small reflection gains 
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud: 
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field. 
As when a vultur on Imaus bred, 
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds, 
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey 
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids, 
On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs 
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; 
But in his way lights on the barren pla49485248515056Sericana, where Chineses drive 
With sails and wind their cany waggons light: 
So, on this windy sea of land, 4948525048524948
Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey; 
Alone, for other creature in this place, 
Living or lifeless, to be found was none; 
None yet, but store hereafter4948525456494948earth 
Up hither like aereal vapours flew 
Of all things transitory and vain, when sin 
With vanity had fill49485255564855works of men: 
Both4948524953484950vain, and all who in vain49485250495456
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame, 
Or happiness 49485253485556or the other life; 
All who have their reward on earth, the fruits 
Of painful superstition and blind zeal, 
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find 
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds49485253525455the unaccomplished w49485255535156Nature's hand, 
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, 
Dissolve4948525550524950fleet49485348515755, and 49485257494855, 
Till final dissol49485255485755wander here; 
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed; 
Those argent fields more likely habitants, 
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold 
Betwixt the angelical and human kind. 
Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born 
First4948535452494948ancient world those giants came49485354505255many a vain exploit, though then renowned: 
The builders next of Babel on the plain 
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design, 
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build: 
Other49485349575255single; he, who, to be deemed 
A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames, 
Empedocles; and h4948534956504949enjoy 
Plato's Elysium49485350495757into the sea, 
Cleombrotu49485350524855many more too long, 
Embryos49485357485655diots, eremite49485350525155friars 
White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery. 
Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek 
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven; 
And they, who to be sure of Paradise, 
Dying, put49485357545256weeds of Dominick, 
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised; 
They pass 49485449504955nets seven, and 49485353545057fixed, 
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs 
The trepidation talked, and that first moved; 
And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems 
To wait them with his keys, and now at foot 
Of 49485356495157ascent they lift their feet, when lo 
A violent cross wind from either coast 
Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry 
In49485454495455devious air:  Then might ye see 
Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost 
And flutter49485456505656rags; then reliques, beads, 
Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, 
The sport of winds:  All these, upwhirled aloft, 
Fly o'er the backside of the world far off 
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called 
The 49485457575656 of Fools, to few unknown 
Long after; now unpeopl49485457485056untrod. 
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he pass49485549485257long he wandered, till at last a gleam 
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste 
His travelled steps: far distant he descries 
Ascending by degrees magnificent 
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high; 
At top whereof, but far more rich, appeare49485457555355work as of a kingly palace-gate, 
With frontispiece of diamond and gold 
Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems 
The portal shone, inimitable on earth 
By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. 
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
Angels as49485550505256and descending, bands 
Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled 
To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz 
Dream49485552535155night und49485556524855open sky 
And waking cried,  This is the gate4948555353484948. 
Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood 
There always, but drawn up to 49485555504955sometimes 
Viewless; and underneath a49485552515655 sea flowed 
Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, 49485554495056
Who after came from earth, failing arrived 
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'49485554495055lake 
Rapt in a chario49485553525256by fiery steeds. 
The4948555749544951then let down, whether to dare 
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate 
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss: 
Direct against which opened from beneath, 
Just 49485555545757blissful seat of Paradise, 
A passage down to the Earth, a 49485554505656wide, 
Wider by far than that of after-49485649544855Over mount Sion, and, though that were large, 
Over the Promised Land to God so dear; 
By which, to visit oft those happy tribes, 
On high behests his angels to and fro 
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard 
From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood, 
To Beersaba49485654515655 the Holy Land 
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore; 
So wide49485748495257ing seemed, where bounds were set 
To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. 
Satan from hence, now on the lower stair, 
That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate, 
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view 
Of all this world at once.  As when a scout, 
Through dark?;nd desart ways with?oeril gone 
All?might,?;t?kast by break of cheerful dawn 
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, 
Which to 49485657555456discovers unaw49485752554957goodly prospect 49485653525056foreign land 
First seen, or some renowned metropolis 
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned49485655514957now the rising sun gilds with his beams: 
Such 49485748525755seised49485753575257after4948574951525549485656505155
The Spirit malign, but much more envy s49485655555155
At sight of 4948575050574953beheld so fair. 
Round he surveys (and well might,49485754525255he stood 
So high above the circling canopy 
Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point 
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears 
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas 
Beyond the horizon; the49485756555455pole to pole 
He views in breadth, and without longer pause 
Down right into the world's first region throws 
His flight precipitant, and wind49485754545555ease 
Through the pure marble air his oblique way 
Amongst innumerable stars, that shone 
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds; 
Or o4948575148534949 they seemed, or happy isles, 
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old, 
Fortunate fields, and grove49485752485655flowery vales, 
Thrice h4948575352534948; but who dwelt happy there 
He staid not to inquire:  A49494849555456m all 
The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven, 
Allured his eye; thither his course he bends 4949484853574951calm firmament, (but up or down, 
By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell, 
Or longitude,) where the great luminary 
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick, 
That from his lordly eye keep distance due, 
Dispenses light from far; they, a49494851575555move 
Their starry dance in numbers that compute 
Days, month49494852525055years, towards his all-cheering lamp 
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned 
By his magnetick beam49494856525055gently warms 
The universe, and to each inward part 
With gentle penetration, though unseen, 
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep; 
So wonderously was set his station bright. 
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps 
Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb4949494848544948his glazed optick tube yet never saw. 
The place he found beyond expressi49494853545257, 
Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone; 
Not all parts like, but all alike informed 
With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; 
If metal, part seemed gold49494853555756ilver clear; 
If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, 
Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone 
In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides 
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere 49494951545655That 49494857505755or like to that which here below 
Philosophers in vain so long have sought, 
In vain49494953565557by their powerful art they bind 
Volatile Herme49494956575355call up unbound 
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea, 
Drained through a limbeck to his native form. 
What wonder then if fields and regions here 
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run 
Potable gold, whe49494955514855one virtuous touch 
The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote, 
Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed, 
Here in the dark so many precious things 
Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?49494952485255matter new to gaze the Devil met 
Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands; 
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, 
B49495052524955sun-shine, as when his beams at noon 
Culminate f49495048535656equator, as they now 
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round 
Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air, 
No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray 
To objects distant far, whereby he soon 
Saw within ken a 49495049564956 Angel stand, 
The same whom John saw also 49495051505755sun: 
His back was turned, but not his brightness hid; 
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar 
Circled his head, nor less his locks behind 
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings 
Lay waving round; on some great charge employed 
He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep. 
Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope 
To find who might direct his wandering flight 
To Paradise, the happy seat of Man, 
His journey's end and our beginning woe. 
But first he casts to change his proper shape, 
Which else might work him danger or delay: 
And now a stripling Cherub he appears, 
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face 
Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb 
Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned: 
Under a coronet his flowing hair 
In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore 
Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold; 
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held 
Before his decent steps a silver wand. 
He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright, 
Ere h49495056495656igh, his radiant visage 49495155565656
Admonished by his ear, and straight was known 
The Arch-Angel Uriel, one49495151565656seven 
Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne, 
Stand ready at command, and are his eyes 
That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth 
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, 
O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.

His chief delight and favour, him for whom 4949515549534955rks so4949515552494949he ordained, 
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim 
Alone thus wandering.  Brightest Seraph, tell 
In which of 49495253505455se shining orbs hath Man 
His fixed seat, or 4949515651524948 hath none, 
But 4949515751575052is choice to dwell; 
That I may find him, and with secret gaze 
Or open admiration him behold, 
On wh49495250535655great Creator hath bestowed 
Worlds, and on whom hath 4949525057554948graces poured49495250504856both in him and all things, as is meet49495257545655universal Maker we may praise; 
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes 
To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss, 
Created 49495348485757happy race of Men 
To serve49495253565555tter:  Wise ar4949535053524948ways. 
So spake the false dissembler unperceived; 
For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks 
Invisible, except to God al49495348555155y his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth: 
And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps 
At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity 
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill 
Where 49495254545255seems:  Which now for once beguiled 
Uriel49495256565157regent of the sun, and held 
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven49495352505655to the fraudulent impostor foul, 
In his uprightness, answer thus returned. 
Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know 
The works of God, thereby to glorify 
The great Work-master, leads to no excess 
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise 
The more it seems49495349505455, that led thee hither 
From thy empyreal mansion thus 49495355565056To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps, 
Contented with report, hear only 49495354515657: 
For wonderful indeed a4949544957514950orks, 
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all 
Had in remembrance always with delight; 
But what created mind can comprehend 
Their number, or the 49495450555255infinite 
That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep? 
I saw when at his word the formless mass, 
This world's material mould, came to a heap: 
Confusion heard his voic49495453575255wild uproar 
Stood ruled, stood vast49495356525556ude confined; 
Till 49495356505555second bidding Darkness fled, 
Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: 
Swift to their several quarters hasted then 
The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire; 
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven 
Flew upward, spirite49495454485755various forms, 
That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars 
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; 
Each had his place appointed, each his course; 
The rest in circuit walls this universe. 
Look downward on that globe, whose49495549565756side 
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; 
That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light 
His day, which else49495453545555e other hemisphere, 
Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon 
So call that opposite fair star) her aid 
Timely interposes, and her monthly round 
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven, 
With borrowed light her countenance triform 
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the 49495457505655
And in her pale dominion checks the night. 
That spot, to which I point, is Paradise, 
Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. 
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. 
Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low, 
As to superiour Spirits is wont in 4949555048574948here honour due and reverence none neglects, 
Took leave49495556555455oward the coast of earth beneath, 
Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success, 
Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel; 
Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights. 
 
 
 
Book IV         4949554950535649495549525749544949554957485053
 
 
O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw 
The Apocalypse, heard cry 49495554525457 aloud, 
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, 
Came furious down to be revenged on men, 
Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now, 
While time was, our first parents had been warned 
The coming of their secret fo49495648514855'scaped, 
Haply so 49495553495155 his mortal snare:  For now 
49495650555255now first inflame49495649514955rage, came down, 
The tempter ere the accuser of mankind, 
To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss 
Of that first battle, and his 49495651545355to Hell: 
Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold 
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, 
Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth 
Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast, 
And like a devilish engine back recoils 
Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract 
His troubled thoughts, and 49495748535457bottom stir 
The Hell within him; for 4949564855484948 Hell 
He bring49495649535355round about him, nor from Hell 
One step, no more than from 49495651525455, can fly 
By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair, 
That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory 
Of what he was, what is, and what must be 
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. 
Sometimes towards Eden, 49495657495755ow 49495748515755view 
Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad; 4949565352544957Heaven, and the full-blazing sun, 
W49495654504857sat high 49495751484955meridian tower: 
Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, 
Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God 
Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars 
Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call, 
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, 
Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, 
That bring to my remembrance from what state 
I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; 
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down 
Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King: 
Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return 
From me, whom he create49495757525355I was 
In that bright eminence49504848505155ith his good 
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. 
What could be less than to afford him praise, 
The easiest recomp4949575249534948pay him thanks, 
How due! yet all 49495752565557proved ill in me, 
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high 
I sdeined subjection49504851545156ought one step higher 
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit 
The debt immense of endless gratitude, 
So burdensome still paying, still to owe, 
Forgetful what from him I still received49495756555455understood not that a grateful mind 
By owing owes not, but 49495756495557s, at once 
Indebted and discharged; what burden then 
O, had his powerful destiny ordained 
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood 
Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised 
A49504855535055!  Yet why not some other Power 
As great might have aspired, and me, though mean, 
Drawn to his part; but 4950484854554949s as great 
Fell 4950485152504949and unshaken, from within 
Or 49504848545157out, to all temptations armed. 
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? 
Thou hadst:49504949575655as4950485050554948n or what to accuse, 
But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all? 
Be then his love accursed, since love or hate, 
To me alike, it deals eternal woe. 
Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will 
Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
Me miserable! which way shall I fly 
Infinite wrath4950495253565649504852565755despair? 
W49504853534957I fly is Hell; myself am49504853515455
And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep 
Still threatening to devour me opens wide, 
To which the Hell I suffer seems a49504948575655. 
O, then, at last relent:  Is there no place 
Left for repentance, none for pardon left? 
None left but by submission; and that word 
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced 
With49504956545655promises and other vaunts 
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue 
The Omnipotent.  Ay me! they little know 
How dearly I abide that boast so vain, 
Under 49504957494855rments inwardly I groan, 
While they adore me on the throne of Hell. 
With diadem and scepter high advanced, 
The lower still I fall, only supreme 
In misery:  Such joy ambition finds. 
But say I could repent, and could obtain, 
By act of grace, my former state; how soon 
Would highth recall high thoughts, 49504952485157unsay 
What feigned sub49505048495055 swore?  Ease w49504953555355cant 
Vows made in pain, as violent and void. 
For never can true reconcilement grow, 
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep: 
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear 
Short inter49504957505356bought with double smart. 
This knows my Punisher; therefore as far 
From granting he, as I from begging, peace; 
All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead 
Mankind created, and for him this world. 
So farewell, hope; and with hope 4950495750564948fear; 
F49504957545057remorse! all good to me is lost; 
Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least 
Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold, 
By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign; 
As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know. 
Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face 
Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair; 
Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed 
Him counterfeit, if any eye behel49505149565356heavenly minds from such distempers foul 
Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware, 
Each perturbation smoothe49505057575155outward calm, 
Artificer of fraud49505148555555as the first 
That practised falsehood under saintly show, 
Deep malice to conceal, couch49505057525556revenge: 
Yet not enough had 4950505550494948to deceive 
Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down 
 The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount 
 Saw him disfigured, 4950515252504948could befall 
 Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce 
 He marked and mad demeanour, then alone, 
 As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen. 
 So on he fares49505155505255o the border comes 
 Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, 
 Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, 
 As with a rural mound, the champaign head 
 Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides 
Access denie49505155554955overhead upgrew 
 Insuperable height of loftiest shade, 
 Cedar, and pine, and fir49505249535155ranching palm, 
 A sylvan sce49505150575455, as the ranks ascend, 
 Shade above 49505152485455a woody theatre 
 Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops 
 The verdurous wall of 49505156495056 upsprung;         4950515250545649505152524955
 
    00081429  
Which to our general sire gave prospect large 
Into his nether empire neighbouring round. 
And 4950515553514952at wall a circling row 
Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit, 
Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue, 
Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed: 
On which the sun more glad impressed his beams 
Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, 
When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed 
That landskip:  And of pure now purer air 
Meets his approach4950525751564951heart inspires 
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive 
All sadness but despair:  Now gentle gales, 
Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense 
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole 
Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who fail 
Beyond the Cape of Hop49505349565755now are past 
Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow 
Sabean odours from the spicy shore 
Of Araby the blest; with such delay 
Well pleased they slack49505351545155cours49505253525255many a league 
Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles: 
So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend, 
Who came49505257535355bane; though49505254515757m better49505255515157
Than Asmodeus wi49505255504855fishy fume49505350575455drove him, 49505254564855enamoured, 4950525753544949ouse 
Of Tobit's son49505349575455ith a vengeance sent 
From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound. 
Now 49505353495555ascent of that steep savage hill 
Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; 
But further way found none, so thick entwined, 
As one continued brake, the undergrowth 
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed 
All path of man or beast that passed that way. 
One gate49505350575355only wa49505357505755that looked east 
On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw, 
Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt, 
At one fligh49505353564955 high over-leaped all bound 
Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within 
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf, 
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, 
Watching where shepherds pen49505451515455flocks at eve 
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, 
Leaps o'er the fence with ease in49505449545155fold: 
Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash 
Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors, 
Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, 
In at the window climbs, or 49505356514857tiles: 
So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold; 
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. 
Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, 
The middle tree and 49505452495156there that grew, 
Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life 
Thereby regained, but sat devising death 
To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought 
Of that life-giving plant, but only used 
For prospect, what well used had been the pledge 
Of immortality.  So little knows 
Any, but God alone, to value right 
The good before him, but perverts best things 
To worst abuse, or to their meanest use. 
Beneath him with new wonder now he views, 
To all delight of human sense exposed, 
In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more, 
A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise 
Of God the garden was, by him in the east 
Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line 
From Auran eastward to the royal towers 
Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, 
Of where the sons of Eden long 49505548525055
Dwelt in Telassar:  In this pleasant soil 
His far more495054545557494849505457504955God ordained; 
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow 
All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; 
And all amid them stood 4950555653494957High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit 
Of vegetable gold; and next to life, 
Our death, t4950554850504949knowledge, grew fast by, 
K49505457555356 of good bought dear by knowing ill. 
Southward through Eden went a river large, 
Nor changed his course, but 49505549505756the shaggy hill 
Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown 
That mountain as his garden-mould high raised 
Upon the rapid current, which, through veins 
Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, 
Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill 
Watere4950565055524950; thence united fell 
Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood, 
Which from his darksome passage now appears, 
And now, divided into four main streams, 
Runs diverse, wandering 49505555515655famous realm 
And country, whereof here needs no account; 
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, 
How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, 
Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold, 
With mazy errour under pendant shades 
Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 
Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art 
In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon 
Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, 
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote 
The open field, and w49505648565357unpierced shade 
Imbrown49505655564855noontide bowers:  Thus was this place 
A happy rural seat of various view; 
Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm, 
Other49505650525756fruit, burnished with golden rind, 
Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, 
If true, here only, and of delicious taste: 
Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks 
Grazing the tender herb, were interposed, 
Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap 
Of some irriguous valley spread her store, 
49505749565056of all hue, and without thorn the rose: 
Another side, umbrageous grots and caves 
Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine 
Lays forth her purple grap49505751555655gently creeps 
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall 
Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake, 
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned 
Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams. 
The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs, 
Breathi49505752555155smell of field and grove, attun49505757505555trembling leaves, while universal Pan, 
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, 
Led on the eternal Spring.  Not that fair field 
Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers, 
Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis 
Was49505750535355ed, which cost Ceres all that pain 
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove 
Of Daphne by Oronte49514850535755the inspired

Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,

True 49505757565057under the Ethiop line 
By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, 
A whole day's journey high, but wide remote 
From this Assyrian garden49514853505456the Fiend 
Saw, undelighted, all 49505756555255, all kind 
Of living creatures, new to s49505757535055nd strange 
Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall, 
Godlike erect, with native honour clad 
In naked majesty seemed lords of all: 
And worth49514848574856; for in their looks divine 
The image of their glorious Maker shone, 
Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure, 
(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,) 
Whence true authority in men; 49514856555255both 
Not equal, a49514857544856sex no4951485149565549514853525557
For contemplation he and valour for4951485157484948softness she and sweet attractive grace; 
He for God only, she 49514852515656in him: 
His fair large front and eye sublime declared 
Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks 
Round 49514953485657parted forelock manly hung 
Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: 
She, as a veil, down to the slender waist 
Her unadorned golden tresses wore 
Dishevelled, 49514950505055wanton ringlets waved 
As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied 
Subjection, but required with gentle sway, 
And by her yielded, by him best received, 
Yielded with coy submission, modest pride49514857575555sweet, reluctant, amorous delay. 
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed; 
Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame 
Of nature's works, honour dishonourable, 
Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind 
With shows instead, mere shows of seeming49515049555056And banishe49514956535355man's life his happiest life, 
Simplicity and spotless innocence! 
So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight 
Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill: 
So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair, 
That ever since in love's embraces met; 
Adam the goodliest man of men since born 
His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. 
Under a tuft of shade that on a green 
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side 
They sat them down; and, after no more toil 
Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed 
To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease 
More easy, wholesome thirst and appetit49514956515456grateful, to 49514957535755upper-fruits they fell, 
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs 49515057495257them, side-long as they sat recline 
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers: 
The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, 
Still49515049535457thirsted, scoop the brimming stream; 
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles 
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems 
Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league, 
Alone 49515053505155.  Abou49515056515655frisking played 
All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase 
In wood or wilderness, forest or den; 
Sporting the lion ramped, 49515151575456is paw

Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant, 
To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed

Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine

Or bedward ruminating; for the sun, 
Declined, was hasting now with prone career 
To the ocean isles4951515549554951ascending scale 
Of Heave49515156535755tars that usher evening rose: 
When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, 
Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad. 
O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold! 
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced 
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, 
Not Spirits, yet to heavenly49515150505256 bright 
Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue 
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines 
In them divine resemblance, and such grace 
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured. 
Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh 
Your change approaches, when all these delights 
Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe; 
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; 
Happy, but for so happy ill secured 
Long to continu49515157515055thi49515249555455seat your 49515252505155

As now is entered; yet no purposed foe 
To you, whom I49515250535655pity thus forlorn, 
Though I unpitied:  League with you I seek, 
And mutual amity, so strait, so close, 
That I 49515157535057must dwell, or you with me 
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please, 
Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such 
Accep49515251574955Maker's work; he gave it me, 
Which I as freely give:  Hell shall unfold, 
To entertain you two, her widest gates, 
And send forth all her kings; there will be room49515350495555like these narrow limits, to receive49515348505355numerous offspring; if no better place, 
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge 
On you who wrong me not for 49515252505056wronged. 
And should I a49515349505155harmless innocence 
Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just, 
Honour and empire with 49515254515756enlarged, 
By conquering this new world, compels me now 
To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. 
So spake the Fiend, and with necessity, 
The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds. 
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree 
Down he alights among the sportful herd 
Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one, 
Now other, as their shape served best his end 
Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied, 
To mark what of49515348485556tate he more might learn, 
By word or action marked. About them round 
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare; 
Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied 
In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, 
Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft 
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, 
Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both, 
Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men 
To 49515351515757women Eve thus moving speech, 
Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow. 
Sole partner, and s49515352525556, of all these joys, 
D49515448535555hyself than all; needs must the Power 
That made us, and for us this ample49515453545056
Be infinitely goo49515453505155of his good 
As liberal and free as 49515354545556; 
That raised us from the dust, and placed us here 
In all this happiness, who at his hand 
Have nothing merited, nor can perform 
Aught whereof h49515452545255need; he who requires 
From us no other service than to keep 
This one, this easy charge4951545056554950 trees 
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
So various, not to tast49515357575155only tree 
Of knowledge, planted by 49515449484956 of life; 
So near grows death to life, whate'er death is, 
Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest 
God hath pronounced it 495154505249574951545152494949tree, 
The only sign of our obedience left, 
Among so many signs of power and rule 
Conferred upon 49515457564856dominion given 
Over all other creatures that possess 
Earth, ai49515550495756ea.  Then let us not think hard 
One easy prohibition, who enjoy 
Free leave so large to 49515549535755ngs else, and choice 
Unlimited of manifold delights: 
But 49515454505555ever praise him, and extol 
His bounty, following our 49515454495755ful task, 
To prune these growing plant49515457514855tend these flowers, 
Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet. 
To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom 
And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, 
And without whom am to no end, my guide 
And head! what thou hast said is just and right. 
For we to him indeed all praises owe49515548495655daily thanks; I chiefly, 4951555254504949So far the happier lot, enjoying thee 
Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou 
Like consort to thyself canst no where find. 
That day I oft remember, when from sleep 
I first awaked, and found myself reposed 
Under a shade on 49515555494957much wondering where 
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Of waters issued from a cave49515651485655pread 
Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved 
Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I 49515553575156went 
With unexperienced th4951555453544949laid me down 
On the green bank, to look into the clear 
Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. 
As I bent down 49515554525755, just opposite 
A shape within the watery gleam appeared, 
Bending t49515556484855on me:  I started back, 
It s4951555457574949; but pleased I soon returned, 
P49515555525555it49515555535257 as soon with answering looks 
Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed 
Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, 
Had not a voice thus warned me;  'What thou seest, 
49515557515156ere 4951555753534950fair Creature, is49515656565156; 
'With thee it came and goes: but follow me, 
'And I will bring thee where no shadow stays 
'Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he 
'Whose imag49515650574955art; him thou shalt enjoy 
'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear 
'Multitudes like4951565251575649515651525056ence be called 
'Mother of human race.'  What could I do, 
B4951565353504948straight, invisibly thus led? 
Till I espied thee49515655505555indeed and tall, 
Under a platane; yet me49515751505155 less fair, 
Less winning soft, less amiably mild, 
Than that smooth 49515751485055image:  Back I turned; 
Thou following cryedst aloud, 'Return49515749494955Eve; 
'Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of h49515748515556art, 
'His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent 
'Out of my side to thee, nearest my he49515655555055Substantial lif49515750525255a49515656484957y m49515655575055
'Henceforth an individual solace dear; 
'Part49515657485256oul I seek thee, 49515751575055e claim 
'My other half:'  With that thy gentle hand 
Seised mine:  I yielded;and from that time see 
How beauty is excelled by manly grace, 
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
So spake our general mother, and with eyes 
Of conjugal attraction unreproved, 
And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned 
On our first father; half her swelling breast 
Naked met his, under the flowing gold 
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight 
Both of her beauty, and submissive charms, 
Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter 
On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds 
That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip 
With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned 
For envy; yet with jealous leer malign 
Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. 
Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two, 
Imparadised in one another's 49515757564955The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill 
Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust, 
Where neither joy no49524849565556but fierce desire, 
Among our other 49524848485455s not the least, 
Still unfulfill49524851554956pain of longing pines. 
Yet let me not forget what I have gained 
From their own mouths:  All is 49524848545755irs, it seems; 
One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called, 
Forbidden them to taste:  K49524848564957for49524848565055
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord 
Envy49524849575455hat?  Can it be sin to know? 
4952484955484948death?  And do they only stand 
By ignorance?  Is that their happy state49524856495655proof of 49524853555355bedience and their faith? 
O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
Their ruin! hence I will excite49524948514855minds49524951485155more desire4952485450515649524950535357reject 
Envious commands, invent49524948505356design 
To keep them low, whom 4952485752534948might exalt 
Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such, 
They taste and die:  What likelier can ensue 
But first with narrow search I must walk round 
This garden, and no corner leave unspied; 
A chance but 49524854565655may lea49524948565455 I may meet 
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side, 
Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw 
What further would be learned.  Live while ye may, 
Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return, 
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! 
So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, 
But with sly circumspection, and began 
Through wood, t49524948545156aste, o'er hill49524948565055dale, his roam 
Mean while in utmost longitude, where 49524953505655
With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun 
Slowly descended, and with right aspect 
Against the eastern gate of Paradise 
Levelled his evening rays:  It was a rock 
Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds, 
Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent 
Accessible from earth, one entrance high; 
The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung 
Still as it rose, impossible to climb. 
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat, 
Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night; 
About him exercised heroick games 
The unarmed youth o49525053555756, but nigh at hand 
Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, 
Hung high with diamond flaming, 49525051505557gold. 
Thither came Uriel, gliding 49525053554856the even 
On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star 
In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired 
Impress the air49525049525355hows the mariner 
From what point of his compass to beware 
Impetuous winds:  He thus began in haste. 
49525053524955, to thee thy course by lot hath given 
Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place 
No evil thing approach or enter in. 
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere 
A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know 
More of the Almighty's work49525056545455chiefly Man, 
God's latest image:  I described his way 
Bent all on speed, and mark49525052504855aery gait; 
But in the mount that lies from Eden north, 
Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks 
Alien from 49525151535356with passions foul obscured: 
Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade 
Lost sight of him:  On49525057535557banished crew, 
I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise 
New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
To wh49525056485455winged warriour thus returned. 
49525155534955no wonder if thy perfect sight, 
Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst, 
See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass 
The vigilance here placed, but such as come 
Well know4952515250554951; and since meridian hour 
No creature thence:  If Spirit of other sort, 
So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds 
On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude 
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar. 
But if with49525157565255circuit of these walks, 
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom 
Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I sha49525154525755. 
So promised he; and Uriel to his charge 
R49525157525255 on that 49525157494955beam, whose point now raised 
Bore him slope downward to 49525248525755 now fallen 
Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb, 
Incredible how swift, had thither rolled 
Diurnal, or this less volubil earth, 
By shorter flight 49525155544855east, had left49525253515455ere 
Arraying with reflected purple and gold 
The clouds that on his western throne attend. 
Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray 
Had in her sober livery all things clad; 
Silence accompanied; for beast and bird, 
They to their grassy couch, these 49525157494957nests 
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; 
She all night long her amorous descant sung4952524955514949was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament 
With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that le49525252565655starry host, rode brightest, till the moon, 
Rising in clouded majesty, at length 
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light, 
And o'49525257535655dark her silver mantle threw. 
When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour 
Of night, and 4952525653524949now retired to rest, 
Mind us of like repose; since God hath set 
Labour and rest, as day and 49525253515755to men 
Successive; and the timely dew of sleep, 
Now fall49525351525357soft slumbrous weight, inclines 
Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long 
Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; 
Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
Appointed, which declares his dignity, 
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways; 
While other animals unactive range, 
And of their doings God takes no account. 
To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east 
With first approach of light, we must be risen49525354504955at our pleasant labour, to reform 
Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, 
Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, 
That mock our scant manuring, and require 
More hands than ours to lop49525352525055wanton growth: 
Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums, 
That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth, 
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; 
Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest. 
To whom thus Eve49525354545255perfect beauty adorned 
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst 
Unargued I obey:  So God ordains; 
God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more 
Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise. 
With thee conversing I forget all time; 
All seasons, and their change, all please alike. 
Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, 
With charm of earliest birds:  49525452575157the sun, 
When first on this delightful land he spreads 
His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, 
Glistering with dew; fragr49525357575456fertile earth 
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on 
Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night49525450535556this her solemn bird49525456515156is fair moon, 
And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train: 
But neither 4952545350494954when she ascends 4952545354545057; no4952545450574948un 
O4952545357505050; nor herb, 495254535555554952545448515148nor 49525454495655ce after s49525454495156
Nor 4952545449565051nor 4952545454515250nor walk by 49525454564855Or glit49525456565355star-light, without thee is sweet. 
But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom 
This glorious s49525453545455hen sleep hath shut all eyes? 
To whom our general ancestor replied. 
Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve, 
These have49525554485256ourse to finish round the earth, 
By morrow evening49525553485255rom land to land 
In order, though to nations yet unborn, 
Ministring light prepared, they set and rise; 
Lest total Darkness should by night regain 
Her old possession, and extinguish life 
In Nature and all things; which49525555535455soft fires 
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat 
Of various influence foment and warm, 
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down 
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow 
On 49525553504855made hereby apter to receive 
Perfection from the sun's more potent ray. 
These then, 49525554525455unbeheld in deep of night, 
Shine not in vain; nor think49525555555457men were none, 
That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise: 
Millions of spiritual creatures walk 49525648545657 
Unseen, both when we wake, and w49525552485755sleep: 
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold 
Both day and night:  How often 4952555653504948teep 
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard 
Celestial voices to the midnight air, 
Sole, or responsive each to others note, 
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands 
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk, 
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds 
In full harmonick number join49525656515455ir songs 
Divide the49525652525156and lift our49525653485755ts to Heaven. 
Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed 
On to their blissful bower: it was a place 
Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed 
All things to Man's delightful use; the roof 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew 
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side 
Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub, 
Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower, 
Iris all hues, rose49525651565055jessamin, 
Reared high49525657555755flourished heads between49525750574855rought 
Mosaick; underfoot the violet, 
Croc49525654485456hyacinth, with rich inlay 
Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone 
Of costliest emblem:  Other creature here, 
Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none, 
Such was their awe of Man.  In shadier bower 
More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned, 
Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph 
Nor Faunus haunted.  Here, in close recess49525755555756flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs, 
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed; 
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung, 
What day the genial Angel to our sire 
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned, 
More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods 
Endowed with all their gift49525757485055O! too like 
In sad event, when to the unwiser son 
Of Japhet b49525756554855by Hermes, she ensnared 
Mankin49525750555255her fair looks, to be avenged 
On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire. 
Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood, 
Both turned, and under open sky adored 
The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven, 
Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe, 
And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night, 
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day49525754515657we, in our appointed work employed, 
Have finished, happy 49525754505155mutual help 
And 49525754494855love, the crown of all our bliss 
Ordained by thee; and this delicious place 
For us too large, where thy abundance wants 
Partaker49534854574955uncropt falls to the ground. 
But thou hast promised from us two a race 
To fill the49534850575356who shall with us extol 
Thy goodness infinite49534852565755when we wake4953485155505549525757505056seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 
This said unanimous, and other rites 
Observing none, but adoration pure 
Which God likes best, into their inmost bower 
Handed they went; and, eased the putting off 
These troublesome disguises which we wear, 
Straight side by side were laid; nor 49534949485056I ween, 
Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the 49534853504955Mysterious of connubi49534857535355 refused: 
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk 
Of purity, and place, and innocence, 
Defaming as impure what God declares 
Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all. 
Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain 
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? 
Hail, wedded Love, m4953485654514948law, true source 
Of human offspring, sole propriety 
In Paradise49534954535056things common else! 
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men 
Among the bestial herds to range; by thee 
Founded in reason, loyal, just49534950504955ure, 
Relations dear, and all the charities 
Of father, son, and brother, first were known. 
Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, 
Or think thee unbefitting holiest49534953565356
Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, 
Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, 
Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used. 
Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights 
His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, 
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile 
Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, 
Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, 
Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball, 
Or serenate, which the starved lover sings 
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. 
These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, 
And on their naked limbs the flowery roof 
Showered roses, 4953495555554948morn repaired.  Sleep on, 
Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek 
No happier state, and know to know no more. 
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone 
Half way up hill this vast sublunar vaul49535048555456from49535048565755ivory port the Cherubim, 
Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed 
To 49535050545055ight watches in warlike parade; 
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south 
With strictest watch; these other wheel the north; 
Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part, 
Half wheeling to the shield, half t49535049575255pear. 
F49535053545755se, two strong and subtle Spirits he called 
That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed 
Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook; 
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, 
Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm. 
This evening 49535149564956 sun's decline arrived, 
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen 
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped 
The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: 
Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
So saying, on he led his radiant files, 
Dazzling the moon4953515256555649535152485355bower direct 
In search of whom they sought:  Him ther49535153535355found 
Squat like a toad, close 49535156575755ear of Eve, 
Assaying by his devilish art to reach 
The organs of her fancy, and with them forge 
Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; 
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint 
The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise 
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise 
At least distempered, discontented 49535156494955s, 
Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, 
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride. 
Him thus intent 4953525153555749535151575555s spear 
Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure 
Touch of celestial temper, but returns 
Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts 
Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark 
Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid 
Fit for the tun some magazine to store 
Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, 
With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; 
So started up in his own shape the Fiend. 
Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed 
So sudden to behold the grisly king; 
Yet thus, unmove49535255495155fear, accost him soon. 
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell 
Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, 
Why sat'49535248515155 like an enemy in wait, 
Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 
Know ye not then said Satan, fill49535251525156scorn, 
4953524954484950me? ye knew me once no mate 
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar: 
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, 
The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know49535253575255ask ye, and superfluous begin 
Your message, like to end as much in vain? 
To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn4953525548564949. 
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy s49535349554957same, 
Or undiminished brightness to be known, 
49535352575756thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; 
That glory then, 4953525451564948no more wast good, 
Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now 
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. 
But come, for49535352565155be sure, shalt give account 
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep 
This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, 
Severe in youthful beauty, added grace 
Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood, 
And felt how awful goodness is49535354554955aw 
Virtue in her49535353545755how lovely; saw, and pined 
His loss; but chiefly to find here observe49535349505756ustre visibly impaired; yet seemed 
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he, 
Best with the best, the sender, not 49535350504855t, 
Or all at once; more glory will be won, 
Or less be lost.  Thy fear49535352485655Zephon bold, 
Will save us trial what the least can do 
Single against thee wicked, 49535357515755nce weak. 
The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; 
But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, 
Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly 
He held it vain; awe from above had quell49535449485056heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh 
The western point, where those half-rounding guards 
Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, 
A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, 
Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. 
O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet 
Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern 
Ithuriel and 49535453535155through the shade; 
And 49535455515056m comes a third of regal port, 
But faded splendour wan; who by his gait 
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, 
Not likely to part hence withou49535548555755st; 
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 
He scarce had ended, when49535455525055two approached, 
And brief related 49535455504956y brough49535456545657found, 
How busied, in what form and posture couched. 
T49535456565255with stern regard thus 49535457505155 spake. 
Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed 
To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge 
Of others, who approve not to 4953545354574948 
By thy example, but have power and right 
To question thy bold entrance on this place; 
Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those 
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! 49535548545457thus Satan with contemptuous brow. 
49535554575555? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise49535551534855such I held thee; but this 49535548565357asked 
Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! 
Who would not, finding way, break loose from 49535555565355Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt49535555545355oldly venture to whatever place 
Farthest from pain49535556525356thou mightst hope to change 
Torment with ease, and soonest recompense 
Dole with deli49535648515355ich in 4953555551544948 I sought; 
To thee no reason, who knowest only good, 
But evil hast not tried: and wilt object 
His will who 49535649535655us!  Let him surer bar 
His iron gates, if he intends our stay 
In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked. 
The rest is true, they found me 49535556494856ey say; 
But that implies not violence or harm. 
Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, 
Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. 
O loss of one in 49535652505356o judge 49535652515655 
Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew49535653505355now returns him from his prison 'scaped, 
Gravely 49535653565056 whether to hold them wise 
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him 49535654515155
Unlicensed 4953555752495749535651535555in Hell prescribed; 
So wise he judges it to fly 49535655485657 
However, and to 'scape his punishment! 
So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath, 
Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight 
Sevenfold49535657545355courge that wisdom back to Hell4953564955524948aught thee yet no better, that no pain 
Can equal anger infinite provoked. 
But wherefore thou alone?4953565048574949with thee 
Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they 
Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief! 
The first in flight 49535655545157! hadst thou alleged 
To thy deserted host this cause of flight, 
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
To w49535657484955e Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. 
Not that I less endure, or shrink 49535749545757, 
Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood 
Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid 
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, 
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear49535750525755still thy words at random, as before, 
Argue thy inexperience49535755555655ehoves 
From hard assays and ill successes past 
A faithful leader, not to hazard all 
Through ways of danger by himself untried: 
I, th49535754545055, I alone49535753535655undertook 
To wing the desolate abyss49535757495055py 
This new created world, whereof in Hell 
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find 
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers 
To settle here on earth, or in mid air; 
Though for possession put to try once more 
What thou and thy gay legions dare against; 
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord 
High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne49544848485255practised distances to cringe, not fi49544851545455o whom the warriour Angel soon replied. 
To say and straight unsay, pretending first 
Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy49544850555456s no49544850485655 but a liear traced, 
Satan, and coulds4953575752505549544851505257add?  O name, 
O sacred name of 49544852485356ness profaned! 
Fa49544852535255to whom? 49544855494955rebellious crew? 
Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. 
Was this your discipline and faith engaged, 
Your military obedience, to dissolve 
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? 
And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem 
Patron of liberty, who more than thou 
Once fawned49544851525055ringe49535757555255servily adored 
Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but 49544857575556
To dis49544857495655 him, and thyself to reign? 
But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant; 
Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour 
Within these hallowed limits thou appear, 
Back49544854495256infernal pit I drag thee chained, 
And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn 
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. 
So threatened he; but Satan to no threats 
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage 4954495252544949hen when I am thy captive talk of chains, 
Prou49544855565355ary Cherub! but ere then 
Far heavier load49544948495657expect to feel 
From my prevailing arm, though He49544950484855King 
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, 
Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels 
In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. 
While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright 
Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns 
Their phalanx, and began to hem him round 
With ported spears, as thick as when a field 
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind 
Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, 
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves 
Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed, 
Collecting all his might, dilated stood, 
Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: 
His stature reached the sky, and on his crest 
Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp 
What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds 
Might have ensued, nor only Paradise 
In this commotion, but the starry cope 
Of 49545050515355perhaps, or all the elements 
At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn49545050525155violence of 49544955505755nflict, had not soon 
The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, 
Hung forth in 49545054494955his golden scales, yet seen 
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign, 
Wherein all things created first he weighed, 
The pendulous round earth with balanced air 
In counterpoise, now ponders all events, 
Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, 
The sequel each of parting and of fight: 
The latter quick up flew, and kick49545055525155beam, 
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; 
Neither our ow49545056495055given:  What folly then 
To boast what arms can do? since thine no more 
Than 4954505753564948mits, nor mine, though doubled now 
To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up, 
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; 
Where thou art4954505753524948and shown how light, how weak, 
If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew 
His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled 
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime 
Advancing, sowed the 4954515356524949orient pearl, 
When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep 
Was aery-49545149545155from pure digestion bred, 
And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound 
Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, 
Lightly dispers49545152545656the shrill matin song 
Of birds on every bough; so mu49545149495755more 
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve 
With tresses discompo49545149565757glowing cheek, 
As through unquiet rest:  He, on his side 
Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love 
Hung over her enamour49545248494856beheld 
Beauty49545153565655, whether waking or asleep, 
Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice 
Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, 
Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.  Awake, 
My fairest, my espoused, my latest found, 
Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight! 
Awake:  The morning shines, 49545248565356fresh field 
Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring 
Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove, 
What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed, 
How nature paints her colours, how the bee 
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet. 
Such 49545249545355ing waked her, but with startled eye 
On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake. 
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, 
My glory, my perfection! glad I see 
Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night 
(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed, 
If 49545248534857not, as I oft am wont, of thee, 
Works of day past, or morrow's next design, 
But of offence and trouble, which my mind 
Knew never 4954525154524948irksome night:  Methought, 
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk 
With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said, 
'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time, 
'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields 
'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake 
'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns 
'Full-orbed the moon49545352495655ith mor49545255525155ing light 
'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain, 
'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes, 
'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire? 
'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment 
'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.' 
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; 
To find thee I directed then my walk; 
And on, m4954535355524948alone I passed through ways 
That brought me on a sudden to the tree 
Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed, 
Much fairer to my fancy than by day: 
And49545448535355wondering looked, beside it stood 
One shaped and winged like one of those from 49545354525755
By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled 
Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed; 
And 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged, 
'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet, 
'Nor God, nor Man?  Is 49545355515257 so despised? 
'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste? 
'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold 
'Longer thy offered good; why else set here? 
This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm 
He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour ch49545448524856t such bold words vouched with a deed so bold: 
But he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine, 
'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt, 
'Forbidden here, 49545453535455s, as only fit 
'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: 
'And why not4954535656544950; since good, the more 
'Communicated, more abundant grows, 
'The author not impaired, but honoured more? 
'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve! 
'Partake thou also; happy though thou art, 
'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be: 
'T49545457485355is, and be henceforth among the Gods 
'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined, 
'But sometimes in the air, as we, 4954545054544948
'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see 
'What life th49545455555655live there, and such 49545451534955ou!' 
So saying, he drew nigh49545552505055o me held, 
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part 
Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell 
So quickened appetite, that I, methought, 
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds 
With him I flew, and underneath beheld 
The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide 
And various:  Wondering at my flight and change 
To this high exaltation; suddenly 
My guide was go495455505349564954554851574952sunk down, 
And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked 
To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night 
Related, and thus Adam answered sad. 
Best image of myself, and dearer half, 
The trouble of th49545557505156ts this night in sleep 
Affects me equally; nor can I like 
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear; 
Yet evil whence?49545648485455e can harbour none, 
Created pure.  But know that 49545649495755soul 
Are many lesser faculties49545557485555serve 
Reason as chief; among these Fancy next 
Her office holds; of all external things 
Which the five watchful senses represent, 
She forms imaginations, aery shapes, 49545651515155Reason, joining or dis49545552505355, frames 
All what we affirm or what deny, and call 
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires 
Into her private cell, when nature rests. 
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes 
To imitate her; but, m495455565051574954555655574949ild work produces oft, and most in dreams; 
Ill matching words49545652525755eds long past or late. 
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find 
Of our last evening's talk, in this thy 49545653535655
But with addition strange; yet be not sad. 
Evil into the mind of God or Man 
May come and go, so unreprove49545657535655leave 
No spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope 
That w49545656504955sleep thou didst abhor to 49545650524956Waking thou never will consent to do. 
Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks, 49545650535555ont to be more cheerful and serene, 
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world; 
And let us to our fresh employments rise 
A49545750565056 groves, the fountains, and the flowers49545654505655open now their choisest bosomed smells, 
Reserved from nigh49545748565755kept for thee in store. 
So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was49545652565556; 
But silently a gentle tear let fall 
From either eye, and wiped them with her hair; 
Two other precious drops that ready stood, 
Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell 
Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse 
And pious awe, that feared to have offended. 
So all was cleared49545750485155o the field they haste. 
But first, from under shady arborous roof 
Soon as they forth were come to open sight 
Of day-spring4954575255484948sun, who, scarce up-risen, 
With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim, 
Shot parallel49545750485056earth his dewy ray, 
Disco49545748565455in wide landskip all the east 
Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains, 
Lowly they bowed ador49545751524957began 
Their orisons, each 49554849485556duly paid 
In various style; for neither 4954575050534951 
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise 
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung 
Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence 
Flowe49554851495155their lips, in prose or numerous verse, 
More tuneable than needed lute or harp 
To add more sweetness; 49554848495455y thus began. 
These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, 
Almighty!  Thine this universal frame, 
Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how4954575450514949then! 
Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens 
To us invisible, or dimly seen 
In these thy lowest works; yet these declare 
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine. 
Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light, 
Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs 
And choral symphonies, day without night, 
Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven 
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol 
Him first, him la49554848505256mids4955485057525549554849545756end. 
Fairest of stars, last in the train of 49554850545556If better thou belong not to the dawn, 
Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn 
With thy bright circlet, 49554949564955him in thy sphere, 
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime. 
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul, 
Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his 49554853515055
In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest, 
And when high noon hast gained, and w49554853505257fallest. 
Moon49554856505355now meet49554856525256orient sun, now flyest, 
49554856565555e fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies; 
And ye five other wandering Fires49554948575355move 
In mystick dance not 49554952495756song, resound 
Hi49554857575456, who out of darkness called up light. 
Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth 
Of Nature's womb49554952504955in quaternion run 
Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix 
And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change 
Vary to our great Maker still new praise. 
Ye Mists and Exhalation49554954565156now rise 
From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray, 
Till the sun pain49554950495455fleecy skirts with gold, 
In honour 49555048535755world's great Author rise; 
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky, 
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers, 
Rising or 49554950544957till advance 4955504952504948. 
4955495653554950ye Wind49555051495756from four quarters blow, 
Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines, 
With every plant, in sign of worship wave. 
Fountains, 49555049504955that warble, as ye flow, 
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune4955495552494952Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds, 
That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend, 
Bear on your wings and in your notes4955504849514952Ye 49555053485356waters glide4955495749534954lk 
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; 
Witness if I be silent, morn or even, 
To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade, 
Made vocal by my song, and taught 4955505254484952ail, universal Lord, be bounteous still 
To give us only good; and if the night 
Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed, 
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark! 
So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts 
Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm. 
On 49555050485057morning's rural work they haste, 
Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row 
Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far 
Their pampered bough49555149525155needed hands to check 
Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine 
To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines 
Her marriageable arm49555152505155with him brings 
Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn 
His barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld 
With pity Heaven's high King49555148555257him called 
Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned 
To travel with Tobia49555148495655secured 
His 49555057515356 with the seventimes-wedded maid. 
49555056525157said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth 
Satan, from Hell 'scaped through49555153554957some gulf, 
Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed 
This night the human pair; how he designs 
In them at once to ruin all mankind. 
Go therefore, half this day as frien4955515350575549555057575655
Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade 
Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired, 
To respite his day-labour with repast, 
O4955514952564948o49555152524856such discourse bring on, 
As may advise him of his happy state, 
Happiness in his power left free to will, 
Left to his own free will, his will though free, 
Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware 
He swerve not, too49555248545755:  Tell him withal 
His danger, and from whom; what enemy, 
Late fallen himself 49555249505655aven, is plotting now 
The fall of others from like state of bliss; 
By violence? no, for that shall be withstood; 
But by deceit and lies:  This let him know, 
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend 
Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned. 
So spake the Eternal Fath49555248535257ulfilled 
All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint 
After his charge received; but from among 
Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood 
Veile49555255564955his gorgeous wings, up springing light, 
Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires, 
On each hand parting, 49555255535055speed gave way 
Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate 
O49555250485756 arrived, t49555249505756self-opened wide 
On golden hinges turning, as by work 
Divine the sovran Architect had framed. 
From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his s49555253554955Star interposed, however small he sees, 
Not unconformed to other shining globes, 
Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned 
Above all hills.  As when by night the glass 
Of Galileo, less assured, observes 
Imagined lands and regions in the moon: 
Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades 
Delos or Samos first appearing, kens 
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight 
He speeds, and th4955535154504948vast ethereal sky 
Sails between worlds and worlds49555348534855steady wing 
Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan 
Winnows the buxom air49555353505756within soar 
Of towering eagles, to 49555354515656fowls he seems 
A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird, 
When, to enshrine his reliques 49555351555455Sun's 
Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies. 
At once 49555350555355eastern cliff of Paradise 
He light49555352535156o his proper shape returns 
A Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade 
His lineaments divine; the pair that clad 
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast 
With regal ornament; the middle pair 
Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round 
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold 
And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet 
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail, 
Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood, 
And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled 
The circuit wide.  Straight knew him a49555451525055bands 
Of Angels under watch; 4955545049484949state4955535557495549555450525655message high, in honour rise; 
For on some m4955535552564949 they guessed him bound. 
Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come 
Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh, 
And fl49555456555356odours, cassia, nard, and balm; 
A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here 
Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will 
Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet, 
Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss. 
Him 49555451495556the spicy forest onward come 
Adam discerned, as in the door he sat 
Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun 
Shot down direct49555548495655rvid rays to warm 
Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs: 
And Eve within, due at her hour prepared 
For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please 
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst 
Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream, 
Berry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called. 
Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold 
Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape 
Comes this way moving; seems another morn 
Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven 
To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe 
This day to be our guest.  But go with speed, 
And49555548484955thy stores contain, bring forth49555555485255our 
Abundance, fit to honour and receive 
Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford 
Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow 
From 4955545757554950ed, where Nature multiplies 
Her fertile grow49555550515356by disburthening grows 
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. 
4955555552574951Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould, 
Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store, 
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; 
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains 
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: 
But I will haste, and from each bough and brake, 
Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice 
To entertain our Angel-guest, as he 
Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth 
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven. 
So saying, wi49555554535055atchful looks in haste 
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent 
What 49555557485255to choose for delicacy best, 
What order, so contrived as 49555651565455mix 
Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring 
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change; 
Bestirs her then4955565155494954tender stalk 
Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields 
In India East or West, or middle shore 
In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where 
Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat 
Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell, 
She gathers, tribute large, and 49555748535055board 
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape 
She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths 
From many a berry4955574956484949sweet kernels pressed 
She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold 
Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground 
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. 
Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet 
His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train 
Accompanied than with his own complete 
Perfections; in himself was all his state, 
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits 
On princes, when their rich retinue long 
Of horses led, and grooms besmeare49555754565555gold, 
Dazzles the crou49555656515555sets them all agape. 
Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed, 
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, 
As to a superiour nature bowing low, 
Thus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place 
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain; 
Since, by descending 49555755484957thrones above, 
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while 
To want, and honour these, vouchsafe49564849545755s 
Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess 
This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower 
To rest; and what the garden choicest bears 
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat 
Be over, and the sun more cool decline. 
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild. 
Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such 
Created, or such place hast here to dwell, 
As may not oft invite, though Spirits 4956484955524949
To visit thee; lead on then where th49555757555157O'ershades; for these mid-hours49555757564955evening rise, 
I have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge 
They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled, 
With flowerets decke49564856515155fragrant smells; but Eve, 
Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair 
Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned 
Of three that in mount Ida naked strove, 
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil 
She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm 
Altered her cheek.  On wh49564948565455Angel Hail 
Bestowed, the holy salutation used 
Long after to blest Mary, second Eve. 
Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb 
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons, 
Than 49564850575055ese various fruits the trees of God 
Have heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf 
Their table was, and mossy seats had round, 
And on her ample square from side to side 
All autumn piled, 49564951565555spring and 49564853495755here 
Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold; 
No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began 
Our author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste 
These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom 
All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends, 
To us for food and for delight hath caused 
The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps 
To spiritual natures; only this I know, 
That one celestial Father gives to all. 
To 4956495553524952.  Therefore what he gives 
(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part 
S49564949545456, may of purest Spirits be found 
No ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure 
Intelligential substances require, 
As doth your rational; and both contain 
Within them every lower faculty 
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, 
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate49565049554955corporeal to in4956495150574949urn. 
For know, whatever was created, needs 
To be sustained and fed:  Of elements 
The grosser feeds the purer, 49565048565155he sea, 
Earth and 49564952564855 feed air, the air49564956575455fires 
Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon; 
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged 
Vapours not yet into her 49565049514857 turned. 
Nor doth 49564955535656 no nourishment exhale 
From her moist continent to higher orbs. 
The sun that light impart49565053565756, receives 
From all his alimental recompence 
In humid exhalations, and at even 
Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees 
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines 
Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn 
We brush mellifluous dew49565049565655fi49565053545355ground 
Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here 
Varied his bounty so with new delights, 
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste 
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat49565149495055to their viands fell; nor seemingly 
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss 
Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch 
Of real hunge49565055545455concoctive heat 
To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires 
Through Spirit49565148495555ease; nor wonder;if by fire 
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist 
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn, 
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold, 
As from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve 
Ministered naked, and their flowing cups 
With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence 
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, 
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been 
Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts 
Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy 
Was understood, the injured lover's hell. 
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed, 
Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose 
In Adam, not to let the occasion pass 
Given him by this great conference to know 
Of things above his world, and of their being 
Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw 
Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms, 
Divine effulgence49565151535156high power, so far 
Exceeded human; and his wary speech 
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed. 
Inhabitant with God, now know I well 
Thy favour, in this honour done to Man; 
Under49565155515155lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed 
To enter49565251535557se earthly fruits to taste, 
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, 
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem 
At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare 
To whom the winged Hierarch replied. 
O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom 
All 49565252485155proceed, and up to him return, 
If not depraved from good, created all 
Such to perfection, one first matter all, 
Endued with various 4956525353555549565157495756degrees 
Of substance, and49565252544856ngs that live, of life; 
Bu49565251545155refined, more spiritous, and pure, 
As nearer 49565250555155placed, or49565248545757ending 
Each in their several active spheres assigned, 
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds 
Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root 
Springs lighter the green stalk, 49565250555356nce the leaves 
More aery, last the bright consummate flower 
Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit, 
Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed, 
To vital s49565253495155aspire, to animal, 
To intellectual; give both life and sense, 
Fancy and understanding; wh49565255555357soul 
Reason receive49565348545155reason is her being, 
Discursive, or intuitive; discourse 
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, 
Differing but in degree, of kind the same. 
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good 
If I refuse not, but convert, as you 
To proper4956535451514948.  Time may come, when Men 
With Angels may participate, and find 
No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; 
And f49565354505155se corporal nutriments perhaps 
Your bodies may at last turn all 49565356505657, 
Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend 
Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice, 
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell; 
If ye be found obedient, and retain 
Unalterably firm his love entire, 
Whose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy 
Your fill what happiness this happy state 
Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied. 
O favourable Spirit, propitious guest, 
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct 
Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set 
From center to circumference; whereon, 
In contemplation of created things, 
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say, 
What meant that caution joined, 4956544953544953
O49565449545455?  Can we want 49565450494955ce then 
To him, or possibly 49565450525457desert, 
Who formed us 49565453554956 dust and placed us here 
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss 
Human desires can seek or apprehend? 4956545248504951Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth, 
Attend!  That thou art happy, owe to God; 
4956535755534948continuest such49565448485357thyself, 
That is, to thy4956545151494948; therein stand. 
This was 4956545254554951given thee; be advised. 
God made thee perfect, not immutable; 
And good he 49565449555057, but to persevere 
He left it in thy power; ordained thy will 
By 49565457515155free, not over-ruled by fate 
Inextricable, or strict necessity: 
Our voluntary service he requires, 
Not our 49565451555156ated; such with him 
Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how 
Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve 
Willing or no, who will but what they must 
By destiny, and can no other choose? 
M49565548555055and all the angelick host, that stand 
In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state 
Hold, as you yours, while our 4956555450524948holds; 
On other surety none:  Freely we serve, 
Because we freely love, as in our will 
To love or not; in this we stand or fall: 
And some are fallen, to diso495654575653574956545652565649565456555555 from 49565556495055to deepest Hell; O fall 
From what high49565549555255of bliss, into what woe! 
To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words 
Attentive, and with more delighted ear, 
Divine instructer, I have heard, than when 
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills 
Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not 
To be both will and deed created free; 
Yet that we never shall forget t49565554555255
Our Maker, and obey him whose command 
Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts 
Assured me, and still assure:  Though49565650494856ou tellest 
Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move, 
But 49565556524955sire to hear, if thou consent, 
The full relation, which must needs be strange, 
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard; 
And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun 
Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins 
His other half in the great zone of Heaven. 
Thus Adam made request; and Raphael, 
After short pause assenting, thus began. 
High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, 
Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate 
To human sense the invisible exploits 
Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse49565652495755ruin of so many glorious once 
And perfect while they stood? how last unfold 
The secrets of another world, perhaps 
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good 
This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach 
Of 4956565252544949, I shall delineate so, 
By likening spiritual to corporal forms, 
As may express them best; though what if Earth 
Be but a shadow 49565657495357, and things therein 
Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? 
As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild 
Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests 
Upon her center poised; when on a day 
(For time, 49565656485255in eternity, applied 
To motion, measures all 49565656535555durable 
By present, past, and future,) on such day 
As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host 
Of Angels by imperial summons called, 
Innumerable before the Almighty's throne 
Forthwith, from all the ends of 49565751505757ppeared 
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright: 
Ten thousand th49565656575255ensigns high advanced, 
Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear 
Stream in the air49565751525055or distinction serve 
Of h49565749564855ies, of orders, and degrees; 
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed 
Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love 
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs 
Of circuit in49574849515155ible they stood, 
Orb within orb, the Father Infinite, 
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son, 
Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top 
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. 
Hear, all ye49574848555255, progeny of light, 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand. 
This day I have begot whom I declare 
My only Son, and on this holy hill 
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold 
At my right hand; your head I him appoint; 
And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow 
All knees in 49574854525357nd shall confess him Lord: 
Under his great vice-gerent reign abide 
United, as one individual soul, 
For ever happy:  Him who disobeys, 
Me 4956575657524948breaks union, and that day, 
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls 
Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place 
Ordained without redemption, w49574848535655end. 
So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words 
All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all. 
Th49574852485056as other solemn days, they spent 
In song and dance about the sacred hill; 
Mystical dance49574948505256yonder starry sphere 
Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels 
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, 
Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular 
Then most, when most irr49574852535655they seem49574950495555in their motions harmony divine 
So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear 
Listens delighted.  Evening now approached, 
(For we49574953564855lso our evening and our morn, 
We ours for change delectable, not need;) 
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn 
Desirous; all in circles as they stood, 
Tables are se49574952545155on a sudden piled 
With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows 
In pearl, in diamon49574857485155massy gold, 
Fruit of delicious vi49574950565455e growth of Heaven. 
On flowers reposed, 49574956495457fresh flowerets crowned, 
They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet 
Quaff immortality and joy, secure 
Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds 
Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showere49574953504856copious hand, rejoicing 49574957505557joy. 
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled 
From that high mount of God, whence light and shade 
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed 
To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there 
In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed 
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest; 
Wide over all the plain49575048575056der far 
Than49574953555155is globous earth in plain outspread, 
(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng, 
Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend 
By living streams among the trees of life, 
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared, 
Celestial tabernacles, where they slept 
Fanned49575052485455ool winds; save those, who, in 49575048525255ourse, 
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne 
Alternate all night long: but not so waked 
Satan; so call him now, his former name 
Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first, 
If 49575054575155 first Arch-Angel, great in power, 
In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught 
With envy against the Son49575148524857that day 
Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed 
Messiah King anointed, could not bear 
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. 
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, 
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour 
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved 
With all his legions to dislodge, and leave 
Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme, 
Contemptuous; and his next subordinate 
Awakening, thus to him in secret spake. 
Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close 
Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree 
Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips 
Of Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy 49575151485555s 
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; 
Both waking we were one; how then can now 
Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed; 
49575057555757from him who reigns, new minds may raise 
In us who serve, new counsels to debate 
What doubtful may ensue:  M49575249505255this place 
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou 
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; 
Tell them49575249575655by command, ere yet dim night 
Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, 
And all who under me their banners wave, 
Homeward, with flying march, where we possess 
The quarters of the north; there to prepare 
Fit entertainment to receive our King, 
The great Messiah, 4957525154504948w commands, 
Who speedily through49575156554955e hierarchies 
Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws. 
So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused 
Bad influence into the unwary breast 
Of his associate:  He together calls, 
Or several one by one, the regent Powers, 
Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught, 
That the Most High49575251575156ing, now ere night, 
N495751565154554957525253494948had disincumbered Heaven495752505753495149575250525056al standard was to move49575254525155s the suggested cause, and casts between 
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound 
Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed 
The wonted signal, and superiour voice 
Of their great Potentate; for49575255545355indeed 
His nam49575251495455high was his degree in49575252535055; 
His countenance, as the morning-star that guides 
The starry flock, allured them, and with lies 
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host. 
Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns 
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, 
And from within the golden lamps that burn 
Nightly before him, saw without their light 
Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread 
Among the sons of morn, what multitudes 
Were banded to oppose his high decree; 
And, smiling, to his only Son thus said. 
Son, thou49575256505556 my glory I behold 
In full resplendence, Heir of all my mi49575354545355early it now concerns us to be sure 
Of our Omnipotence, a49575351545156what arms 
We mean to hold what anciently we claim 
Of deity or empire:  Such a foe 
Is rising, who intends to erect his throne 
Equal to ours, through49575352525455 spacious north; 
Nor so content, hath in his thought to try 
In battle, what our power is, or our right. 
Let us advis49575448535255to this hazard draw 
With speed what force is left, and all employ 
In our defence; lest unawares we lose 
This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. 
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear, 
Lightning divine, ineffable, serene, 
Made answer.  Mighty Father49575448535255thy foes 
Justly hast in derision, and, secure, 
Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain, 
Matter to me of glory, whom their hate 
Illustrates, when they see all regal power 
Given me to quell49575355485555prid49575451535455in event 
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue 
Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven. 
So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers, 
Far was advanced on winged speed; an host 
Innumerable as the stars of night, 
Or s49575356514856morning, dew-drops, which the sun 
Impearls on every leaf and every flower. 
Regions they passed, the mighty regencies 
Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones, 
In their triple degrees; regions to which 
All thy dominion, Adam, is no more 
Than what this garden is to all the earth, 
A49575548535755the sea, from one entire globose 
Stretched into longitude; which having 49575452545056
At length into the limits of the north 
They came; and Satan to his royal seat 
High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount 
Raised on 4957545152515549575457535455pyramid49575550525355owers 
From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold; 
The palace of great Lucifer, (so call 
That structure in the dialect of men 
Interpreted,)49575549535655not long after, he 
Affecting all equality with God, 
In imitation of that mount whereon 
Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven, 
The Mountai49575455505355e Congregation called; 
For thither he assembled all his train, 
Pretending so commanded to consult 
About the great recep4957545756574948eir King, 
Thither to come, and with calumnious art 
Of counterfeited truth thus held49575555544855ears. 
49575556485057Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
If these magnifick titles yet remain 
Not merely titular, since by decree 
Another now hath to himself engrossed 
All power, and us eclipsed under the name 
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste 
Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here, 
This only t4957555452554948how we may best, 
With what may be devised of honours new, 
Receive him coming to receive from us 
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile! 
Too much to one! but double how endured, 
To one, and to his image now proclaimed? 
But what if better counsels might erect 
Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke? 
Will ye submit your neck49575554485655choose to bend 
The supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust 
To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves 
Natives and sons4957565550484948 possessed before 
By none; and if not equal all, yet free, 
Equally free; for orders and degrees 
Jar not with liberty, but well consist. 
Who can in reason then, or 49575648555155assume 
Monarchy over such as live by right 
His equals, if in power and splendour less, 
In freedom equal? or can introduce 
Law and edict on us, who without law 
Err not? much less for this to be our Lord, 
And look for adoration, to the abuse 
Of those imperial titles, which assert 
Our being ordained to govern, not to serve. 
Thus far his bold discourse49575652505257controul 
Had audience; when among the Seraphim 
Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored 
The Deity, and divine commands obeyed, 
Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe 
The current of his fury thus opposed. 
O argument blasphemous, false, and proud! 
Words which no ear ever to hear in 49575751535455
Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate, 
In place thyself so high above thy peers. 
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn 
The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn, 
That to his only Son, 49575753535357endued 
With regal scepter, every soul 4957574851484949Shall bend the kne49575749514955in that honour due 
Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest, 
Flatly 49575657495057o bind with laws the free49575755554855equal over equals to let reign, 
One over all with unsucceeded power. 
Shal49575751555755give law to God? s4957574853514948dispute 
With him the points of liberty, who made 
Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of 49575752565457uch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? 
Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, 
And of our good and 49575750554855dignity 
How provident he is; how far 50484848535055ought 
To make us less, bent rather to exalt 
Our happy state, under one head more near 
United.  But to grant it thee49575757575757
That 4957575754554956monarch reign: 
Thyself, though great and glorious, do50484852485756count, 
Or all angelick nature joined in one, 
Equal to him begotten Son? by whom, 
As by his Word, the Mighty Father made 
All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of 50484854485556By him create50484854495555eir bright degrees, 
Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, 
Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, 
But more illustrious made; since he the head 
One of our number thus reduced becomes; 
His laws our laws; all honour 50484852515455done 
Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage50484856575355tempt not these; but hasten to appease 
The incensed Father504848525755555048484954544950Son, 
While pardon may be found in time besought. 
So spake the fervent Angel50484851545355is zeal 
None seconded, as out of season judged, 
Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced 
The Apostate, and, more haughty, 50484855544955plied. 
That we were formed then sayest thou? 50484854565656work 
Of secondary hands, by task transferred 
From 50484951485655to his Son? strange point and new! 
Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw 
Wh50484948575256creation was? remember50484855575656 
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? 
We know no time when50484857555357not as now; 
Know none before us, self-begot50484855515755raised 
By 50484952545355 quickening power, when fatal course 
Had circled his full orb, the birth mature 
Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons. 
Our puissance 50484857525155own; 50484948545056right hand 
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try 
Who 50484949485755equal:  Then thou shalt behold 
Whether by supplic50484952565155e intend 
Address, and to begirt the almighty throne 
Beseeching or besieging.  This report, 
These tidings carry to the anointed King; 
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. 
He said; and, as the sound of waters deep, 
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause 
Through the infinite host; nor less for that 
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone 
Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold. 
O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed, 
Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall 
Determined, and thy hapless crew involved 
I50485053545355perfidious fraud, contagion spread 
Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth 
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke 
Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws 
Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees 
Against thee are gone forth without recall; 
That golden scepter, which thou didst reject, 
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break 
Thy disobedience.  Well t5048504850544948advise; 
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly50485056545356wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath 
Impendent, raging into sudden flame, 
Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel 
His thunder on thy head, devouring fire. 
Then who created thee lamenting learn, 
W50485050525757an uncreate thee thou shalt know. 
So spake the 50485149545455Abdiel, faithful found 
Among the faithless, 50485051535357only he; 
Among innumerable false, unmoved, 
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, 
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; 
Nor number, nor example, with him wrought 
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, 
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed, 
Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained 
Superiour, nor of violence feared aught; 
And, with retorted 50485055575255his back he turned 
On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed. 
 
 
 
Book VI         5048505649555650485056524949545048505656505053
 
 
All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued, 
Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn, 
Waked by the circling Hours50485150565556osy hand 
Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave 
Within the mount of God, fast by his throne, 
Where light and darkness in perpetual round 
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes thro5048515255514948 
Grateful vicissitude, like day and night; 
Light issues forth, and at the other door 
Obsequious 50485152565157enters, till her hour 
To veil the Heaven, though 50485154484957there might well 
Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn 
Such as in highest50485155495156arrayed in gold 
Empyreal; from before her vanished Night, 
Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain 
Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright, 
Chariots, and flaming arms50485154545255iery steeds, 
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: 
War he perceived, war in procinct; and found 
Already known what he for news had thought 
To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed 
Among those friendly Powers, who him received 
With joy and acclamations loud, that one, 
That of so many myriads fallen, yet one 
Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill 
They led him high applauded, and present 
Before the seat supreme50485254565355whence a voice, 
From midst a golden c50485251525056us mild was heard. 
Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought 
The better fight, who single hast maintained 
Against revolted multitudes the cause 
Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms; 
And for the testimony of truth hast borne 
Universal reproach, far worse to bear 
Than violence; for this was all thy care 
To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds 
Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now 
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, 
Back on thy foes more glorious to return, 
Than scorned thou didst depar50485354495155to subdue 
By force, who reason 50485348575255ir law refuse, 
Right 5048525557555048, and 5048525651504948King 
Messiah, who by ri50485349505755merit reigns. 
Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince, 
And thou, in military prowess next, 
Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons 
Invincible; 5048534849564949my armed Saints, 
By thousands and by millions, ranged for 50485356535155
Equal in number to that Godless crew 
Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms 
Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven 
Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss, 
Into their place of punishment, the gulf 
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide 
His fiery Chaos to rece50485352535655ir fall. 
So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began 
To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll 
In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign 
Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud 
Ethereal trumpe50485356555155on high 'gan blow: 
At which command the Powers50485450575255nt, 
That stood for Heaven50485451545255ghty quadrate joined 
Of union irresistible, moved on 
In silence50485454545455bright legions, 50485450565155sound 
Of instrumental harmony, that breathed 
Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds 
Under their God-like leaders, in the cause 
Of 50485453485556his Messiah.  On they move 
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill, 
Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides 
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground 
Their march was, 50485453504856passive air upbore 50485449545555nimble tread; as when the total kind 
Of birds, in orderly array on wing, 
Came summoned over Eden t504855485257494850485451485756ames of thee; so over many a tract 
Of Heaven50485454485755arched, and 50485451485355province wide, 
Tenfol50485548555455ength of this terrene:  At last, 
Far50485456515456horizon 50485457565555north appeared 
From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched 
In battailous aspect, and nearer view 
Bristled with upright beams innumerable 
Of rigid spear50485457565655helmets throng50485456504856shields 
Various, with boastful argument portrayed, 
The banded 50485554515355of Satan hasting on 
With furious expedition; for they weened 
That self-same day, by fight or by surprise, 
To win the mount of God, and on his throne 
To set the Envier of his state, the proud 
Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain 
In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed 
At first, that Angel should with Angel war, 
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet 
So oft in festivals of joy and love 
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire, 
Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout 
Of battle now began, and rushing sound 
Of onset ended soon each milder 50485553535555. 
High50485648564956midst, exalted as a God, 
The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, 
Idol of majesty divine, enclosed 
With flaming Cherubim, and golden50485649545356; 
Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now 
"twixt host and host but narrow space was left, 
A dreadful interval, and front to front 
Presented stood in terrible array 
Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van, 
On the rough edge of 50485648564955ere it joined, 
Satan, with va50485556535756aughty strides advanced, 
Came towering, armed in adamant and gold; 
Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood 
Amo50485652534955mightiest, bent on highest deeds50485654535755thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
O Heaven!50485648484955uch resemblance of the Highest 
Should yet remain50485648574956faith and realty 
Remain not:  Wherefore 50485748485055not strength and might 
There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove 
Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable? 
His puissance, trusting 50485748505555Almighty's aid, 
I mean to try, whose reason I have tried 
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, 
That he, who in debate of truth hath won, 
Should win in arms, in both disputes alike 
Victor; 50485653565655brutish that contest and foul, 
When 50485653555355hath to deal with force, yet so 
Most 50485654545355is that 50485654575355overcome. 
So ponde50485750505555nd from his armed peers 
Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met 
His daring foe, at this prevention more 
Incensed, and thus securely him defied. 
Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached 
The highth of thy aspiring unopposed, 
The throne of God unguarde50485656555555his side 
Abandoned, at the terrour 50485656545555power 
Or potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain 
Against the Omni50485657485757 rise in arms; 
Who out of smallest things could, without end, 
Have raised incessant armies to defeat 
Thy folly; or with solitary hand 
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow, 
Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed 
Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest 
All are not 50485754485555train; there b50494848565455faith 
Prefer, and piety to God, 50494848555555then 
To thee not visible, when I alone 
Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent 
From all:  My sec5048575348554950;now learn too late 
How few sometimes may know, when thousands err. 
Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, 
Thus answered.  Ill for50485756535755but in wished hour 
Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnes50485755564956flight, seditious Angel! to receive 
Thy merited reward, the first assay 
Of this right hand provoked, since50485755575655that tongue, 
Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose 
A third par50494851495055e Gods, in synod met 
Their deities to assert; who, while they feel 
Vigour divine within them, can allow 
O50494856515556ce to none.  But well thou comest 
Before thy fellows, amb50494850535755to win 
From me some plume, that thy success may show 
Destruction to the rest:  This pause between, 
(Una50494853575255 lest thou boast) to let thee know, 
At first I though50494853485355Liberty and Heaven 
To heavenly souls had been all one; but now 
I see that most through sloth had rather serve, 
Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song! 
Such ha50494852574856armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, 
Servility with freedom to contend, 
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove. 
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied. 
Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find 
Of erring, from the path of truth remote: 
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name 
Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains, 
Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same, 
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels 
Them whom he governs.  This is 5049485656544949
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled 
Against his 50494857505055r, as thine now 50494857484957e, 
Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled; 
Yet lewdly darest our min50494954485356upbraid. 
Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve 
In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine 
Behests obey, 50494951564857 to be obey50494950495657chains5049494957494948not realms, expect:  Mean while 
From me returned, as er50494957575256saidst, from flight, 
This greeting on thy impious crest receive. 
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, 
Which hung not, but so swift50494957575155empest fell 
On the proud50494952505255of Satan, that no s50494953494955Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield, 
Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge 
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee 
His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth 
Winds under ground, or waters forcing way, 
Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, 
Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised 
The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see 
Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout, 
Presage of victory, and fierce desire 
Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound 
The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of 50495055565255
It sounde50495048525755the faithful armies rung 
Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze 
The adverse legions, nor less hideous joine50495051564855horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose, 
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now 
Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed 
Horrible discord5049505252494948madding wheels 
Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise 
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss 
Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew50495053555355flying vaulted either host with fire. 
So under fiery cope together rushed 
Both battles main, with ruinous assault 
And inextinguishable rage.  All 50495148545756Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth 
Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when 
Millions of 50495151574855encountering Angels fought 
On 50495057485555side, the le50495152495155whom could wield 
These elements, and arm him with the force 
Of all their regions:  How much more of power 
Army against army numberless to raise 
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, 
Though not destroy, their happy native seat; 
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent, 
From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled 
And limited their might; though numbered such 
As each divided legion might have seemed 
A numerous host; in strength each armed hand 
A legion; led in fight, yet leader 50495150515156Each warriour single as in chief, expert 
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway 
Of battle, open when, and when to close 
The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight, 
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed 
That argued fear; each on himself relied, 
As only in his arm the moment l50495154525055victory:  Deeds of eternal fame 
Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread50495154565055war and various; sometimes on firm ground 
A standing 50495248524955then, soaring on main wing, 
Tormented 50495253525255 air; all air50495250525456then 
Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scal50495249515055battle hung; till Satan, who that day 
Prodigious power had show50495250575155met in arms 
No equal, ranging through the dire attack 
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length 
Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled 
Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway 
Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down 
Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand 
He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb 
Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield, 
A vast circumference.  At his approach 
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil 
Surceas50495251575456glad, as hoping here to end 
Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued 
Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown 
And visage all inflamed first thus began. 
Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, 
Unnamed 5049525452494949now plenteous as thou seest 
These acts of hateful strife, h50495253525655to all, 
Though heaviest by just measure on thyself, 
And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed 
Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought 
Misery, uncreated till the crime 
Of thy rebellion! ho5049525655514950instilled 
Thy malice into thousands, once upright 
And faithful50495349545455roved false!  But think not here 
To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out 
From all her confines.  5049535355514950seat of bliss, 
Brooks not the works of violence and war. 
Hence then, and evil go with thee along, 
Thy offspring, to the place5049535550504948Hell; 
Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils, 
Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom, 
Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God, 
Precipitate thee with augmented pain. 
So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus 
The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind 
Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds50495354575755canst not.  H50495450485357turned the least of these 
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise 
Unvanquished, easier to transact with me 
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and 50495449505555reats 
To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end 
The strife which thou callest evil, but we style 5049535552484950of glory; which we mean to win, 
Or turn this 50495454485355itself 50495455515655e Hell50495452535555fablest; here however to dwell free, 
If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force, 
And join him named Almighty to thy aid, 
I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh. 
They ended parle, and both addressed for fight 
Unspeakable; for who, though50495548515257 tongue 
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things 
Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift 
Human imagination to such highth 
Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed, 
Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms, 
Fit to decide the empire of great50495456525255. 
Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air 
Made horrid circles; two broad suns50495452535455shields 
Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood 
In horrour:  From each h50495551545157speed retired, 
Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng50495550505055left large field, unsafe with50495456495555wind 
Of such commotion; such as, to set forth 
Great 50495549575555by small, if, nature's concord broke, 
Among the constellations war were sprung, 
Two planets, rushing from aspect malign 
Of fiercest 50495549535155ion, in mid sky 
Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound. 
Together both with next to al50495556565455arm 
Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed 
That might determine, and not need repeat, 
As not of power at once; nor odds appeared 
In might or swift prevention:  But the sword 
Of Michael from the armoury of God 
Was given him tempered so50495649535555neither keen 
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met 
Th50495551515456of Satan, with steep force to smite 
Descending50495649564957half cut sheer; nor staid, 
But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared 
All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain, 
And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore 
The griding50495556524855with discontinuous wound 
Passed through him5049555753544949ethereal substance closed, 
Not long divisible; 50495555495055m the gash 
A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed 
Sanguine, 50495654545355 celestial Spirits may bleed, 
And all his armour stained, ere while so bright. 
Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run 
By Angels many and strong, who interposed 
Defence, while others bore him on their shields 
Back50495557565056chariot, where it stood retired 
From off the files of war:  There they him laid 
Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, 
To find himself not matchless, and his pride 
Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath 
His confidence to equal God in power. 
Yet soon he healed; for 50495654525456that live50495656525156out 
Vital in every part, not as frail man 
In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins, 
Cannot but by annihilating die; 
Nor i50495655545056liquid texture mortal 50495749565355Receive, no more than can the fluid air: 
All heart they live, all head, all ey50495652515555ear, 
All intellect, all sense; and, as they please, 
They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size 
Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare. 
Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved 
Memorial50495751565256the might of Gabriel fought, 
And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array 
Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied, 
And at 5049575454564949-wheels to drag him bound 
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven 
Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon 
Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms 
And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing 
Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe, 
Though hug50504848565655in a rock of diamond armed, 
Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai, 
Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods 
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned 50504848575157flight, 
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail. 
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy 
The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow 
A5049575549484948Arioch, and the violence 
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew. 
I50504850495455relate of thousand50504852494855their names 
Eternize here on earth; but those elect 
Angels, content5049575652505650495756555555ame in Heaven, 
Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort, 
In might though wonderous 50504850505556cts of war, 
Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom 
Cancelled from 50504853555355and sacred memory, 
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. 
For strength from truth divided, and from just, 
Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise 
And ignominy; yet to glory aspires 
Vain-glorious50504852554956rough infamy seeks fame: 
Therefore eternal silence be their doom. 
And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved, 
With many an inroad gored; deformed rout 
Entered50504851565355oul disorder; all the ground 
With shivered armour strown, and on a heap 
Chariot and charioteer lay overturned, 
And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled 
O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host 
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised, 
Then first with 5050485249574954and sense of pain, 
Fled 50504857545255ious, to such evil brought 
By sin of disobedience; till that hour 
Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain. 
Far otherwise the inviolable Saints, 
In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire, 
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed; 
Such high advantages their innocence 
Gave them above50504952505355foes; not to have sinned, 
Not 50504855545056disobeyed; in fight they stood 
Un50504950575357unobnoxious to be pained 
By wound, though from their place by violence moved, 
Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven 
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos5050495548495750504957545056on the odious din of war: 
Under her cloudy covert both retired, 
Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field 
Michael and his Angels prevalent 
Encamping, placed in guard their watches round, 
Cherubick waving fires5050495150534948other part, 
Satan with his rebell50504952565655sappeared, 
Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest, 
His potentates to council called by night; 
And 50504952524855midst thus undismayed began. 
O now in danger tried, now known in arms 50505049504856be overpowered, Companions dear, 
Found worthy not of liberty alone, 
Too mean pretence! but what we more affect, 
Honour, dominion, glory, and renown; 
Who50505052544955ustained one day in doubtful fight, 
(And if 50504954555755, why not eternal days?) 
What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send 
Against us from about his throne, and judged 
Sufficient to subdue us to his will, 
But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems, 
Of future we may deem him50505057505757till now 
Omnis50505048505655hought.  True is, less firmly armed, 
Some disadvantage we endured and pain, 
T50505048565556not known, but, 50505048505055as soon contemned; 
Since now we find this our empyreal form 
Incapable of mortal injury, 
Imperishable, and50505051555457pierced with wound, 
Soon closing, and by native vigour healed. 
Of evil then so small as easy think 
The remedy; perhaps more valid arms, 
Weapons more violent, when next we meet, 
May serve to better us, and worse our foes, 
Or equal what between us made the odds, 
In nature none:  If other hidden cause 
Left them superiour, while we can preserve 
Unhurt our mind50505054545355understanding sound, 
Due search and consultation will disclose. 
He sat; and in the assembly next upstood 
Nisroch, of Principalities the prime; 
As one he stood escaped from cruel fight, 
Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn, 
And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake. 
Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free 
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard 
For Gods, and too un50505152495655ork 50505155535555, 
Against5050505753505750505149515456fight in 505051574950555050505757534948pained, impassive; from which evil 
Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails 
Valour or strength50505157565757matchless, quelled with pain 
Which all subdue50505156565355makes remiss the hands 
Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well 
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, 
But live cont50505249575755ich is the calmest life: 
But pain is perfect misery, the worst 
Of evils, and, excessive, overturns 
All patience.  He, who therefore can invent 
With what more forcibl50505154554957offend 
Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm 
Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves 
No less than for deliverance what we owe. 
Whereto with look composed Satan replied. 
Not uninvented tha50505157575757thou aright 
Believest so main to our success, I bring. 
Which of us who beholds the bright surface 
Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand, 
This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned50505250515555plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gem50505256524855gold; 
Whose eye so superficially surveys 
These things, as not to mind50505256575356ence they grow 
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, 
Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touch50505250564957Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth 
So beauteous, opening to the ambient light? 50505251565255in their dark nativity the deep 
Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame; 
Which, into hollow engines, long and 50505253545555
Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire 
Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth 
From far, with thundering noise, among our foes 
Such implements of mischief, as shall dash 
To piece50505348565355o'erwhelm whatever stands 
Adverse, that50505257535456all fear we have disarmed 
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. 
Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn, 
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive; 
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined 
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired. 
He ended, and his words 50505352535455rooping cheer 
Enlighten50505256565556their languished hope50505348535255d. 
The invention all admired, and each, how he 
To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed 
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought 
Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race 
In future days, if malice should abound, 
Some one intent on 5050535648564948or inspired 
With devilish machination, might devise 
Like instrument to plague the sons of men 
For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent. 
Forthwith from council to the work they flew; 
None arguing stood; innumerable hands 
Were ready; in a moment up they turned 
Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath 
The originals of nature in their crude 
Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam 
They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art, 
Concocted and adusted they reduced 
To blackest grain, and into store conveyed: 
Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth 
Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone, 
Whereof to found their engines and their balls 
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed 
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. 
So all ere day-spring, under conscious night, 
Secret they finish50505457555556in order set, 
With silent circumspection, unespied. 
Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared, 
Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms 
The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood 
Of golden panoply, refulgent host, 
Soon banded; others from the dawning hills 
Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, 
Each quarter to descry the distant fo50505456554857 lodged, or whither fled, or if for f50505455565355In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met 
Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow 
But firm battalion; back50505551555655peediest sail 
Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, 
Came flying, 50505549524855mid air aloud thus cried. 
Arm, Warriours, arm 50505456525657; the foe at hand, 
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit 
This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud 
He come50505551565355settled in his face I see 
Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each 
His adamantine coat gird well, and each 
Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield, 
Borne even or high; for this day will pour down, 
If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, 
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. 
So warned he them, aware themselve50505552485756oon 
In order, quit of all impediment; 
Instant without disturb they took alarm, 
And onward moved embattled:  When behold! 
Not 50505649495757ar with heavy pace 50505556544956
Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube 
Training his devilish enginery, impaled 
On every side50505650495355hadowing squadrons deep, 
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood 
A while; but suddenly at head appeared 
Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud. 
Vanguard, to right and left50505554555655ont unfold; 
That all may see who hate us, how we seek 
Peace and composure, and with open breast 
Stand ready to receive them, if they like 
Our overture; and turn not back perverse: 
But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven! 
Heaven, 50505555575755 thou anon! while we discharge 
Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand 
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch 
What we propound, and loud that 50505651485756hear! 
So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce 
Had ended; when 5050565349575056
Divide50505649545455to either flank retired: 
Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange, 
A triple mounted row of pillars laid 
On wheels (for like to 50505650504856most they seemed, 
Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, 
With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,) 
Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths 
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide, 
Portending hollow truce:  At each behind 
A Serap50505752545155, and in his hand a reed 
Stood waving tipt with fire; 50505750485356, suspense, 
Collected stood within our thoughts amused, 
Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds 
Put forth50505749575757a narrow vent applied 
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame, 
But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, 
From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar 
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, 
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul 
Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail 
Of iron globes; which, on the victor host 
Levelled,50505750554955uch impetuous fury smote, 
That, whom they hit, none50505749515755ir feet might stand, 
Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell 
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled; 
The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might 
Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift 
By quick contraction or remove; but now 
Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout; 
Nor served it to relax50514852485255serried files. 
What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse 
Repeated50514852535256decent overthrow 
Doubled, would render them yet more despised, 
And to 50514848485055oes a laughter; for in view 
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row, 
In posture to displode50505756565257cond tire 
Of 50514851564855:  Back defeated to return 
They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight5050575752534948his mates thus in derision called. 
O Friends! why come not on these victors proud 
Ere while50514853525655ierce were coming; and when we, 
To entertain them fair with open front 
And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms 
Of composition, straight they change50514850565556minds, 
Flew off50514854485156to strange vagaries fell, 
As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed 
Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps 
For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose, 
If our proposals once again were heard, 
We should compel them to a quick result. 
To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood. 
Leader! the50514855485555we sent were terms of we50514948484855Of hard contents, and full of force urged home; 
Such as we might perceive amused them all, 
And stumbled many:  Who receives them right, 
Had need from head to foot well understand; 
Not 50514853555355ood, this gif50514949545655have besides, 
They show us when our foes walk not upright. 
So they among themselves in pleasant vein 
Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond 
All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might 
To match with their invention50514953535355presu50514953515355 easy, and of his thunder made a scorn50514950554855all his host derided, while they stood 
A50514857515155in trouble505149545654555051485755564949not long; 
Rage prompte50514952575156t length50514953565655ound50514953525355rms 
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. 
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, 
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) 
Their arms away they threw, and to the hills 
(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven 
Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,) 
Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew; 
From their foundations loosening to and fro50515049525656plucked the seated hills, with all their load, 
Rocks, waters, wood50515053485755by the shaggy tops 
Up-lifting bore them 50515050555557hands:  Amaze, 
Be sure50514956564855errour, seized the rebel host, 
When coming towards them so dread50515050575755aw 
The bottom of the mountains upward turned; 
Till on those cursed engines' triple-row 
They saw them whelmed, and 5051504851564948confidence 
Under the weight of 5051495748534948buried deep; 
Themselves invaded next, and o50515049525257eads 
Main promontories flung, which in the air 
Came shadowing50515057534855ppressed whole legions armed; 
T50515055495056our helped their harm, crushed in and bruised 
Into50515054525355substance pent50515049545256wrought them pain 
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan; 
Long struggling underneath, er50515057485755could wind 
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, 
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. 
The rest, in imitation, to like arms 
Betook them50515148504955he neighbouring hills uptore: 
So hills amid50515055565357encountere50515150575157
Hurled t50515151545157 with jaculation dire; 
That under ground they fought in dismal shade; 
Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game 
To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped 
Upon 5051505353544948rose:  And now all Heaven 
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread; 
Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits 
Shrined in his sanctuary of 50515056485155secure, 
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen 
This tumult, and permitted all, advised: 
That his great purpose he might so fulfil, 
To honour his anointed Son aveng50515149575557his enemies50515152565055o declare 
All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son, 
The Assessour of his throne, he thus began. 
Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, 
Son, in whose face invisible is beheld 
Visibly, what by Deity I am; 
And 50515149555357hand 50515149535656decree I do, 
Second Omnipotence! two days are past, 
T50515150484955, as we compute the days 50515155534857, 
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame 
These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight, 
As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed; 
For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest, 
Equal in their creation they were formed, 
Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought 
Insen50515157555255for I suspend their doom; 
50515249565555in perpetual fight they needs must last 
Endless, and no solution will be found: 
War wearied hath performed what war can do, 
And to disordered rage let loose the reins 
With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes 
Wild work in 50515251565556and dangerous to the main. 
50515252575356 are therefor50515253525456the third is thine50515252484856hee I have ordained it50515252505656us far 
Have suffered, that the glory may be thine 
Of ending this great war, since none but Thou 
Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace 
Immense50515250535256transfus50515250524957all may know 
In50515348495355 and Hell thy power above compare; 
And, this perverse commotion governed thus, 
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir 
Of all things; 5051525056554948, and to be King 
By sacred unction, thy deserved right. 
Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might; 
Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels 
That shake50515348535255's basis, bring forth all my war, 
My bow 50515348515455nder, my almighty arms 
Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; 
Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out 
From all 5051525557494948ounds in50515352505755utter deep: 
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise 
God, and Messiah his anointed King. 
He said, and on his Son with rays direct 
Shone full; he all his Father full expressed 
Ineffably into his face received; 
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake. 
O50515352525655, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones, 
First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st 
To glorify thy Son, I 50515348535355thee, 
As is most just:  This I my glory account, 
My exaltation, and my whole delight, 
That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will 
Fulfilled, which to fulfil is 50515357515055bliss. 
Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume, 
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end 
Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee 
For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest: 
But 5051535248574948hatest, I hate, and can put on 
Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on, 
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, 
Armed with thy might, rid Heaven50515354495555se rebelled; 
To their prepared ill mansion driven down, 
To chai5051545455524954and the undying worm; 
That from thy just obedience could revolt, 
Whom to obey is happiness entire. 
Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and 50515356555655e impure 
Far separate, circling thy holy m50515453554855Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, 
Hymns of high praise50515452525656among them Chief. 
So said, he, o'er his s50515454535455bowing, rose 
F50515449524956right hand of Glory where he sat; 
And the third sacred morn began to shine, 
Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushe50515454515655whirlwind sound 
The chariot of Paternal Deity, 
Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, 
Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed 
By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each 
Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all 
And wings were se50515452555155eyes; 50515451545057 the wheels 
Of beryl50515551535056reering fires between; 
Over their heads a crystal firmament, 
Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure 
Amber50515454504955olours of the showery arch. 
He, in celestial panoply all armed 
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, 
Ascended; at his 5051555148494949Victory 
Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow 
And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; 
And from about him fierce effusion rolled 
Of smok50515554575455bickering flame, and sparkles dire: 
Attended50515457555755en thousand 50515456554856 Saints, 
He onward came; far off his coming shone50515556525056wenty 50515548495357(I their number heard) 
Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; 
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime 
On the 50515554574855line sky, in 5051555548564953d, 
Illustrious far and wide; but by his own 
First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, 
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed 
Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; 
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced 
His army, circumfused on either wing, 
Under their Head imbodied all in one. 
Before him Power Divine his way prepared; 
At his command the uprooted hills retired 
Each to his place; they heard his voic50515650524955went 
Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, 
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. 
This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured50515555545255to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, 
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. 
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? 
But to convince the proud what signs avail, 
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? 
They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, 
Grieving to see his glory, at the sight 
Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, 
Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud 
Ween50515650485355prosper, and at length prevail 
Against God and 50515748535355, or to fall 
In universal ruin last; and now 
To final battle drew, disdaining flight, 
Or faint retreat; wh50515751494956reat Son of God 
To all his host 5051575052564948hand thus spake. 
Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, 
Ye Angels armed; this day from 50515654485655rest: 
Faithful hath been your warfare, and 50515654524956Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; 
And as ye have received, so have ye done, 
Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew 
The punishment to o5051565749564948belongs; 
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: 
Number to 50515657555356's work is not ordained, 
Nor multitude; stand only, and behold 
God's indignation on these godless poured 
By me; not you, but me, they have despised, 
Yet envied; a50515753575055me is all their rage, 
Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme 
Kingdom, and pow50515756485556glory appertains, 
Hath honoured me, accord5051575757524949will. 
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; 
That they may have their wish, to try with me 
In 50524848514855which the stronger proves; they all, 
Or I alone50515752565357them; since by strength 
They measure all, of other excellence 
Not emulous, nor care who them excels; 
Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. 
So spake the Son, and into terrour changed 
His countenance too severe to be beheld, 
And full of wrath bent on his enemies. 
At once the Four spread out their starry wings 
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs 
Of his fierce chariot rolled, as 50515756535756 sound 
Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. 
He50515756525456impious foes right onward drove, 
Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels 
The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, 
All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon 
Among them he arrived; in his right hand 
Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent 
Before him, such as in 50524851545555ouls infixed 
Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost50524850504855courage; dow50524849484856idle weapons dropt: 
O'er shield50524853555055helm5052484855534948med heads he rode 
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, 
That wished the mountains now might be again 
Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. 
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell 
His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four 
Distinct with eyes, and 50524851574957liv505248575651495050524852485557alike with multitude of eyes; 
One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye 
Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire5052494954554949 accursed, that withered all 50524953555256rength, 
And of their wonted vigour left them drained, 
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen. 
Yet half his 50524855544956 he put no50524856545355, but checked 
His 50524953485355 in mid volley; for he meant 
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: 
The overthrown he raised, and as a herd 
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged 
Drove them be5052495652535650524956565756-struck, pursued 
With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds 
And crystal wall 50524949565157; which, opening wide, 
Rolled inward50524950515555 spacious gap disclosed 
Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight 
Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse 
Urged 50524952515455hind:  Headlong themselves they threw 
Down 50525049505757verge5052495254554950eternal wrath 
Burnt after them 50524953565157ttomless pit. 
Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw 
Heaven ruining from Heaven50524955574855ould have fled 
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep 
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. 
Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared, 
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall 
Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout 
Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last 
Yawning receive50525049554955whole, and on them closed; 
Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire 
Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain. 
Disburdened 50525050545256ejoice50525056505255soon repaired 
Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. 
Sole victor, fr50525053565255expulsion of his foes, 
Messiah his triumphal chariot turned: 
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood 
Eye-witnesses 50525049515555almighty acts, 
With jubilee advanced; and, a50525057545755went, 
Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright, 
Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King, 
Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, 
Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode 
T50525054485455nt through mi50525055574956, into the courts 
And temple 50525055525755Mighty Father throned 
On high; who into glory him 50525149505256, 
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. 
Thus, measuring things in 50525149525655by 50525053485055on Earth, 
At thy request, and that thou mayest beware 
By what is past, to thee I have revealed 
What might have else to human race been hid; 
The discord which befel, and war5052505654544949
Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall 
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled50525152564955Satan; he who envies now thy state, 
Who now is plotting how he may seduce 
Thee also from obedience, that, with him 
Bereaved of happiness, th5052515148504948partake 
His punishment, eternal misery; 
Which would be50525157565357solace and revenge, 
As a despite done against the Most High, 
Thee once to gain companion 50525249515255woe. 
But listen not to his temptations, warn 
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, 
By terrible example, the reward 
Of dis50525153555757; firm they 5052515657504949stood, 
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. 
 
 
 
Book VII         5052515151555650525151544949545052515248495052
 
 
Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name 
If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine 
Following, above the Olympian hill I soar, 
A50525153534957flight of Pegasean wing! 
The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou 
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top 
Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born, 
Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed, 
Thou with 50525253514956Wisdom didst converse, 
Wisdom thy siste50525250575655with her50525156534955play 
In presence50525248535256Almighty Father, pleased 
With thy celestial song.  Up led by thee 
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed, 
An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air, 
Thy tempering: with like safety guided down 
Return me to my native element: 
Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once 
Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,) 
Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall, 
Erroneous there to wand50525349554957orlorn. 
Half yet remains unsung, but narrower boun50525255485555in the visible diurnal sphere; 
Standing on earth, not rapt 5052535049574948pole, 
More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged 
To hoarse or mute, 50525255515456allen on evil days, 
O50525252564949495052525350504952, and evil tongues; 
In darkness, 50525350535257dangers compassed round, 
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou 
Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn 
Purples the east: still govern thou my song, 
Urania50525349545055it audience find, 50525351485656ew. 
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance 
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the ra50525256534955that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard 
In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears 
To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned 
Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend 
Her son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores: 
For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream. 
Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael, 
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned 
Adam, by dire example, to beware 
Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven 
To those apostates; lest the like befall 
In Paradise to Adam or his race, 
Charged not to touch the interdicted tree, 
If they transgress, and slight that sole command, 
So easily obeyed amid the choice 
Of all tastes else to please their appetite, 
Though wandering.  He, with his consorted Eve50525357525355story heard attentive50525454494955as filled 
With admiration and deep muse, to hear50525452505755ings so high and strange; things, to their thought 
So unimaginable, as hate5052544956504948, 
And war so near the peace of God in bliss, 
With such confusion: but the evil, soon 
Driven back, redounded as a flood on those 
From whom it sprung; impossible to mix50525449565555blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed 
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now 
Led on, yet sinless50525452555755desire to know 
What nearer might concern him, how this world 
Of 50525457485355and Earth conspicuous first began; 
When, and whereof created; for what cause; 
What within Eden, or without, was done 
Before his memory; as one whose drouth 
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, 
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, 
Proceeded thus to ask50525455544956venly guest. 
Great50525549495157and full of wonder in our ears, 
Far differing from 5052545651534948, thou hast revealed, 
Divine interpreter! by favour sent 
Down 50525453575455e empyrean, to forewarn 
Us timely of what might else have been our loss, 
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach; 
For which to the infinitely Good we owe 
Immortal thank50525548495655his admonishment 
Receive50525552555255solemn purpose to observe 
Immutably his sovran will, the end 
Of what we are.  But since 5052555049504948vouchsafed 
Gently, for our instruction, to impart 
Things above earthly thought50525550515756yet 50525556514955ed 
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed, 
Deign to desce50525648515355lower, and relate50525648515355may no less perhaps avail us 50525553505155
How 5052564853524949 this 50525649495155which we behold 
Distant so high50525553505355moving fires adorned 
Innumerable; and this which yields or fills 
All space, the ambient air wide interfused 
Embracing rou50525551534856floried Earth; what cause 
Moved the Creator, in his holy rest 
Through all eternity, so late to build 
In Chaos50525553575156e work begun, how soon 
Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold 
What we, not to explore the secrets ask 
Of his eternal empire, but the more 
To magnify his works, 50525553565757we know. 
A50525555545455great light of day yet wants to run 
Much of his race though steep; suspense in50525650515055, 
Held by thy voice, thy potent 50525555495755he hears, 
And longer will delay to hear thee tell 
His generation, 50525649554856rising birth 
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: 
Or if the star of evening 50525651524856moon 
Haste to thy audience, Night with he50525648575255bring, 
Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch; 
Or we can bid his absence, till thy song 
End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine. 
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought: 
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild. 
This also thy request50525750495455caution asked, 
Obtain; 50525655555055to recount almighty works50525748504856ords or tongue of Seraph can suffice, 
Or heart of ma50525651505357 to comprehend? 
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve 
To glorify the Maker, and infer 
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld 
Thy hearing; such commission from above 
I have received, to answer thy desire 
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain 
To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope 
Things not revealed, which the invisible King, 
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night; 
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: 
Enough is left besides to search and know. 
But5052574854564949is as foo50525754495055needs no less 
Her temperance over appetite, to know 
In measure 50525752534955e mind may well contain; 
O50525749535655s else with surfeit, and soon turns 
Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind. 
Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven 
(So call him, brighter once amidst the host 
Of Angels, than that star the stars among,) 
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep 
Into his place, and the great Son returned 
Victorious 50525751525457Saints, the Omnipotent 
Eternal Fath50525753525456his throne beheld 
Their multitude50525752544955o his Son thus spake. 
At least our envious Foe hath fai50534849544855o thought 
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid 
This inaccessible high strength, the seat 
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed, 
He trusted to have seised, and into fraud 
Drew many, whom their place knows here no more: 
Yet far the greater part have kept, I see, 50534848505355station; Heaven, yet populous, retains 
Number sufficient to 50525757535255 her realms 
Though wi50534850485557his high temple to frequent 
With ministeries due50534855485256lemn rites: 
But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm 
Already done, to have dispeopled50534849544857
My damage fondly deemed, I can repair 
That detriment, if such it be to lose 
Self-lost; and in a moment will create 
Another world, out of one man a race 
Of men innumerable, there to dwell, 
Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised, 
They open to themselves at length the way 
Up hither, under long obedience tried; 
And Earth be changed to 50534856545656and Heaven to Earth, 
One kingdom, joy and union without end. 
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven50534853515055thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee 
This I perform; speak thou, and be it done! 
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee 
I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep 
Within appointed bounds be 50534857485155and Earth; 
Boundless 50534854575056, because I Am who fill 
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. 
50534954505755I, uncircumscribed myself, retire, 
And put not forth my goodness, which is free 
To act or not, Necessity and Chance 
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate. 
So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake 
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. 
Immediate are the acts of God, more swift 
Than time or motion, but to human ears 
Cannot 50534955534956process of speech be told, 
So told as earthly notion can receive. 
Great triumph and rejoicing was in 50535048514856
When such was heard declared the 50534953495356's will; 
Glory they sung to the Most High, good will 
To future me50535050535655in their dwellings peace5053495157534948o Him, whose just avenging ire 
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight 50535051555555e habitations of the just; to Him50534954524856and praise, whose wisdom had ordained 
Good out of evil to create; instead 
Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring 
Into their vacant room50535050545255hence diffuse 
His good to worlds and ages infinit50535052485256ang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son 
On his great expedition now appeared, 
Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned 
Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love 
Immens50535055565455all his Father in him shone. 
About his chariot numberless were poured 
Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones, 
And Virtues, winged 50535051575655, and 50535048555755s winged 
From the armoury of God; where stand of old 
Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged 
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand, 
Celestial equipage; and now came forth 
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived, 
Attendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide 
Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound 
On golden hinges moving, to let 50535052574955The King of Glory, in his powerful Word 
And Spirit, coming 50535150565757 new worlds. 
On heavenly ground they stood; and f50535057485756shore 
They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss 
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, 
Up5053505453544948bottom turned by furious winds 
And surging waves, as mo50535149554855, to assault 
Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole. 
Silence, ye troubled W50535056495455nd thou Deep, peace, 
Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end! 
Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim 
Uplifted, in paternal glory rode 
Far into Chao50535148524957e world unborn; 
For Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train 
Followed in bright procession, to behold 
Creation, 5053514950544948nders of his might. 
Then staid the fervid wheel5053515248535550535155565355hand 
He took the 50535156574855compasses, prepared 
In God's eternal store, to circumscribe 
This universe, and all created things: 
One foot he50535155535555ed, 50535153545456other50535157485456
R50535248545355rough5053524852524948profundity obscure; 
And said, Thus far extend, t50535151515256thy bounds, 
This be thy just circumference, O World! 
Thus God the Heaven5053515449535650535152575755the Earth, 
Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound 
Cover50535252564955abyss: but50535249565457atery calm 
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread, 
And vital virtue infuse50535157535155vital warmth 
Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged 
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs, 
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed 
Like things to like; the rest to several place 
Disparted, and between spun 50535248505756air50535251555755Earth self-balanced on her center hung. 
Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light 
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, 
Sprung from the deep50535248565655rom her native east 
To journey 5053525650574950aery gloom began, 
Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun 
Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle 
Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good50535349494955light from d50535257565056by the hemisphere 
Divided: light the Day, and 50535251514857Night, 
He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn: 
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung 
By the celestial quires, when orient50535254515555
Exhaling first 5053525454504952they beheld; 
Birth-day of Hea50535254514956Earth; with joy and shout 
The hollow universal orb they filled, 
And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised 
God and his works; Creator him they sung, 
Both when first evening was, and 5053525549504949morn. 
Again, God said,  L5053535353564950firmament 
Ami50535351505655aters, and let it divide 
The waters5053535357494948waters; and God ma5053525653555650535257495557, expanse of liquid, 50535355515155Transparent, elemental air, diffused 
In circuit to the uttermost convex 
Of this great round; partition firm and s505353485753555053534956564948underneath 50535448495755ose above 
Dividing: for as earth, so he the world 
Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide 
Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule 
Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes 
Contiguous might distemper50535450555155ole frame: 
And 50535448485255he named the F50535355574956:  So even 
And morning chorus sung the second day. 
The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet 
Of 50535357575056embryon immature involved, 
Appeared not: over all the face of Earth 
Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm 
Prolifick humour softening all her globe, 
Ferment50535356515255great mother to conceive, 
Satiate with genial moisture; when 5053545350504948
Be gathered now ye505354514853495150535448554956
Into one place5053545448504948dry land appear. 
Immediately the mountains huge50535355555355 
Emergent, 50535451565255ir broad bare backs upheave50535357495355the clouds; their tops asce50535453495755sky: 
So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low 
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, 
Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they 
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, 
As drops on dust conglobing 50535548544855e dry: 
Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, 
For haste; such flight 5053545456534948command impressed 
On the swift floods:  As armies at the call 
Of trumpet (for of 50535450525455thou hast heard) 
Troop to their standard; so the watery throng, 
Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, 
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, 
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; 
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide 
With serpent errour wandering, found50535550535355way, 
And on the washy oose deep channels wore; 
Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, 
All but within those banks, where rivers now 
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. 
The dry land, Earth; 5053555456505550535551515155receptacle 
Of congregated waters, 50535551535355ed Seas: 
And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth 
Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, 
And fruit-tree 50535457515157fruit50535553515455her kind, 
Whose seed is in herself up50535551575355Earth.

Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, 
Brough5053555149504950te50535555515055ass, whose verdure clad 
Her universal face with pleasant green; 
Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered 
Opening their various colours, and made gay 
Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, 
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept 
The swelling gourd, up st50535651555055 corny reed 
Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub50535651565455bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last 
Rose, as in dance, the stately tree50535556515155spread 
Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemme5053555453494948lossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned; 
With tufts the valley50535649505155each fountain side50535555535256borders long the rivers: that Earth now 
Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, 
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt 
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained 
U505356565350495150535653575356n to 50535656525056 ground 
None was; but from5053565754564948 a dewy mist 
Went up, and watered all50535648575249495053565154564949

God made50535653494855very herb, before it grew 
On the green stem:  God saw that 50535650535755good: 
So even and morn recorded the third day. 
Aga50535651554855Almighty spake, Let there be lights 
High 50535652545655expanse of 50535656485756to divide

And 50535657565056 two great 50535654565256great for their use

50544852524955eir 50544857495355luminaries that set and rose, 
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. 
And God said, Let the waters generate

Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,

Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathe50545154484857downy breast; the swan with arched neck, 
Between her white50545148515555mantling proudly, rows 
Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit

The mid aereal sky:  Others on ground 
Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds

Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue 
Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus 
With fish replenished5054515152504948air with fowl, 
Evening and morn solemniz50545157505155fifth day. 50545152575255xth50545250495655f creation last, arose 
With evening harps and matin; when God said, 
Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, 
Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of 50545153515657, 
Each in their kind50545155575555Earth obeye50545155575155straight 
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth 
Innumerous 50545155525755creatures, perfect forms, 
Limbed and full grown:  Out 5054515649515550545250575155up rose, 
As from his lair, the wil50545157504856where he wons 
In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; 
Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: 
The cattle50545249525455 field50545251494955eadows green: 
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks 
Pasturing at onc50545251565355in broad herds upsprung50545253574955grassy clods now calved; now half appeared 
The tawny lion, pawing to get free 
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, 
And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce, 
The libbar5054534854494949tiger, as the mole 
Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw 
In hillocks:  The swift stag from under 50545256525755
Bore up his branching head:  Scarce5054525749574948mould 
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved 
His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating 5054534951564948plants:  Ambiguous between sea and lan50545257484955river-hors50545353484955scaly crocodile. 
At once came forth whatever creeps5054535248504949, 
Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans 
For wings50545255495055mallest lineaments exact 
In all the liveries decked of summer's pride 
With spots of gold and purple, azure and 5054535356484948ese, as a line, their long dimension drew, 
Streaking t50545348505257 with sinuous trace; not all 
Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind, 
Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved 
Their snaky fold50545350515755added wings.  First crept 
The parsimonious emmet, provident 
Of future; in small room large heart enclosed; 
Pattern of just equality perhaps 
Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes 
Of commonalty:  Swarming next appear50545351565555 female bee, that feeds her husband drone 
Deliciously, and buil50545350535155waxen cells 
With honey stored:  The rest are numberless, 
And thou50545448495155natures knowest, and gavest them names, 
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown 
The 50545357495655, subtlest beast of 50545449565556field, 
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes 
And hairy mane terrifick, though 50545354535056
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. 
Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled 
Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand 
First wheeled their course:  Earth 50545450545455rich attire 
Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth, 
By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked, 
Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained: 
There wanted yet the master-work, the end 
Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone 
And brute as other 5054535757525650545451575555endued 
With sanctity of reason, might erect 
His st50545449505255and upright with front serene 
Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence 
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven, 
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good 
Descends, thither with heart, and voic50545456554955eyes 
Directed in devotion, to adore 
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief 50545455525256his works:  therefore the Omnipotent 
Eternal Father (for where is not he 
Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake. 
Let us make now Man in our image, Man 
In our similitud50545552485755let them rule 
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air, 
Beast50545551495156field, and over all the Earth, 
And every creeping thing that creep50545554545356ound. 
This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man, 
Dus50545456525157ground, and in thy nostrils breathed 
The50545455545255 of life; in his own image he 
Creat50545457504857in the image of God 
Express; and thou becamest a living soul. 
Male he creat50545548574855; but thy consort 
Female, for race; then blessed mankin50545551495055said, 
Be fruitful, multiply, and fi5054555157484950; 
Subdue i50545556485155throughout dominion hold50545553545355fish 50545553524955sea5054554952535550545554485055the air, 
5054555355514948505455515156555054555356574949moves on the Earth. 
Wherever thus 50545552505055, for no place 
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, 
He brought thee into this delicious grove, 
This garden, planted with the trees of God, 
Delectable both to behold and taste; 
And freely 50545649515455ir pleasant fruit for food 
Gave50545557495555all sorts are here that 5054565056504951 yields, 
Variety without end; but 50545651575355tree, 
Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil, 
Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest; 
Death is the penalty imposed; beware50545654545555govern well thy appetite; lest Sin 
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. 
Here finished he, and all that he had made 
Viewe5054565650565550545650505556ll was entirely good; 
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day: 
Yet not t50545655525356Creator from his work 
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned, 
Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode; 
Thence5054565453564949this new50545656555056 world, 
The addition of his empire, how it showed 
In prospect 50545650565257throne, how good, how f50545749525656swering his great idea.  Up he rode 
Followed with acclamation, and the sound 
Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned 
Angelick harmonies:  The earth, the air 
Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,) 
The heavens5054565754514949e constellations rung, 
The planets in their station listening stood, 
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant. 
Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung, 
5054565353535750545748565455! your living doors;let in 
The great 505457505555505050545750535056 
Magnificent, his six days work, a World; 
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign 
To visit oft the dwellings of just men, 
Delighted; and with frequent intercourse 
Thither will send his winged messengers 
On errands of supernal grace.  So sung50545749525155lorious train ascending:  He through Heaven, 
That opened wide her blazing portals, led 
To God's eternal house direct the way; 
A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold 
And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear, 
Seen in the galaxy50545757535155milky way, 
Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest 
Powdere50554849545555stars.  And now on Earth the seventh 
Evening arose in Eden, for the sun 
Was set, and twilight from the east came on, 
Forerunning night; when at the holy mount 
Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne 
Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure50554852554955Filial Power arrived, and sat him down 
With his great Father; for he also went 
Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege 
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained, 
Author and End of all things; and, from work 
Now resting, blessed and hallowed the 50554849535756day, 
As 50545755525655 on that day from all his work, 
But not in silence holy kept: the harp 
Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe, 
And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, 
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire, 
Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice 
Choral or unison: of incense clouds, 
Fuming from 50554849495155censers, hid the mount. 
Creation 50554853495556six days acts they sung: 
Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite 
Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue 
Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return 
Than 50554949545557giant Angels:  Thee th50554855565455
Thy thunders magnified; but to create 
I50554949495055er than created to destroy. 
Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound 
Thy empire!  Easily the proud attempt 
Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain, 
Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought 
Thee to diminish, and 50554856535056e withdraw 
The number of 50554948525655shippers.  Who seeks 
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves 
To manifest5055495056505550554950515155might: his evil50554857485055usest5055485654534952nce createst more good. 
Witness this new-made world, another Heaven 
From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view 
On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea; 
Of amplitude almost immense, with stars 
Numerous, and every star perhaps a world 
Of destined habitation50554954534855hou knowest 
Their seasons: among these the seat of Men, 
Earth50554949565055her nether ocean circumfused, 50554949535755pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men, 
And sons50554950525357whom God hath thus advanced! 
C50555048514855in his image, there to dwell 
And 50554956535055 him; and in reward to rule 
Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air50554952535455multiply a race of 5055504854484949 
Holy and just:  5055495356554950, if they know50554955535556happiness, and persevere upright! 
So sung they, 50555052495455 empyrean rung 
With halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept. 
And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked 
How first this world and f50554956505555things bega50555048535056what befo50555053525456emory was done 
From the beginning; that posterity, 
Informed by thee, might know:  If else thou seekest 
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear 
So charming left his voice50555050545555he a while 
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear; 
Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied. 
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence 
Equal, have I to render thee, divine 
Historian, who thus largely hast allayed 
The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed 
This friendly condescension to relate 
Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard 
With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, 
With glory attributed to the high 
Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains, 
Which only thy solution can resolve. 
When I behold this goodly frame, th50555151564856, 
Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute 
Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain, 
An atom, with the firmament compared 
And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll 
Spaces incomprehensible, (for such 50555056535755distance argues, and their swift return 
Diurnal,) merely to officiate light 
Round this opacou50555148525157this punctual50555148555355
One day and night; in 50555148555556vast survey 
Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire, 
How Nature wise and frugal could commit 
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand 
So many nobler bodies to create, 
Greater so manifold, to this one use, 
For aught appears, and on their orbs impose 
Such restless revo50555156525455day by day 
Repeated; while the sedentary 50555156485755
That better might with far less compass move, 
Served by more noble than herself, attains 
Her end without least motion, and receives, 
As tribute, such a sumless journey brought 
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; 
Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails. 
So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed 
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve 
Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight, 
With lowliness majestick from her seat, 
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay, 
Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, 
To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, 
Her nursery; they at her coming sprung, 
And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew. 
Yet went she not, as not50555256525356ch discourse 
Delighted, or not capable her ear 
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved, 
Adam relating, she sole auditress; 
Her husband the relater she preferred 
Before the Angel50555349504855f him to ask 
Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix 
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute50555256495455conjugal caresses: from his lip 
Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now 
Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?50555348565055Goddess-like demeanour forth she went, 
Not unattended; for on her, as Queen, 
A pomp of winning Graces waited still, 
And from about her shot darts of desire 
Into all eyes, to5055535156514950ill50555352575057. 
And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed, 
Benevolent and facile thus replied. 
To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven 
Is as the book of God b50555351505657e set, 
Wherein to read his wonderous work50555351505755learn 
His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: 
This to attain, whether50555348495556move or Earth, 
Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest 
From Man or Angel the great Architect 
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge50555350495256crets to be scanned by them who ought 
Rather admire; or50555350514855ey list to try 
Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens 
Hath left to their50555448555556s, perhaps to move 
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide 
Hereafter; when they come to model 50555356495656And calculate the stars, how they will wield 
The mighty frame; how build, un50555351524855contrive 
To save appearances; how gird the sphere50555452515155centrick and ec50555352505557scribbled o'er, 
Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb: 
Already by thy reasoning this I guess, 
Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest 
That bodies bright and greater should not serve 
The less not bright, no50555453565157such journeys run, 
Earth sitting still, when she alone receives 
The benefit:  Consider first, that great 
Or 50555357505555infers not excellence: the Earth 
Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small, 
Nor glistering, may of solid good contain 
More plenty than the sun that barren shines; 
Whose virtue on itself works no effect, 
But in the fruitful Earth; there first50555451494856d, 
His beams, unactive else, their vigour find. 
Yet not to Earth are those 50555454485155luminaries 
Officious; bu50555549485456e, Earth's habitant. 
And for 5055555048534948's wide circuit, let it speak 
The Maker's high magnificence, who built 
So spacious, and his line stretched out so far; 
That Man may know he dwells not in his own; 
An edifice too large for him to fill, 
Lodged in a small partition; and the rest 
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known. 
The swiftness of those circles attribute, 50555550494955 numberless, to his Omnipotence, 
That to corporeal substances could add 
Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow, 
Who since the morning-hour set out from50555555495556
Where God reside50555549525455ere mid-day arrived 
In Eden; distance inexpressible 
By numbers that have name.  But this I urge, 
Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show 
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved; 
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem 
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. 
God, to remove his ways from human sense, 
Placed 50555551564955from Earth so far, that earthly sight, 
If it presume, might err in things too high, 
And no advantage gain.  What if the sun 
Be center to the world; and other stars, 
By his attractive virtue 50555648535455ir own 
Incited, dance about him various rounds? 
Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid, 
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, 
In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these 
The plane50555556505455, so stedfast though she seem, 
Insensibly three different50555649575755s move? 
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe, 
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities; 
Or save 50555648574956his labour, and that swift 
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed, 
Invisible else above all stars, the wheel 
Of day and night; which needs not thy belief, 
If 50555649515355industrious of herself, fetch day 
Travelling east, and with her part averse 
From 50555654485455's beam meet night, her other part 
Still luminous by his ray5055565553574951at light, 
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air, 
To the terrestrial moon be as a star, 
Enlightening her by day, as she by night 
This earth? reciprocal, if land be there, 
Fields and inhabitants:  Her spot50555656485455seest 
As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce 
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat 
Allotted there; and other suns perhaps, 
With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry, 
Communicating male and female light; 
Which two great sexes animate the world, 
Stored in each orb 50555654514855 with some that live. 
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed 
By living soul, desart and desolate, 
Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute 
E50555655565556a glimpse of 50555751514955conveyed so far 
Down to this habitable, which returns 
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. 
But whether thus these things, or 50555656495756not; 
5055565653554952e sun, predominant in Heaven, 
Rise on the earth; or earth r5055565748564949sun; 
He from the east his flaming road begin; 
Or she from west her silent course advance50555754514856inoffensive pac50555753494855spinning sleeps 
On50555756485157 ax50555751565355le she paces even, 
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along; 
Sollicit not thy thought50555755575455matters hid; 
Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear! 
Of other creatures, as him pleases best, 
Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou 
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise 
And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high 
To know what passes there; be lowly wise: 
Think only what concerns thee, and thy being; 
Dream not of other worlds, what c50555755574956 there 
Live, in what state, condition, or degree; 
Contented that thus far hath been revealed 
Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven. 
To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied. 
How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure 
Intelligence of 50564854545756Angel serene! 
And, freed from intricacies, taught to live 
The easiest way; nor with perplexing 50564853565557
To interrupt the sweet of life, from which 
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares, 
And not molest us; unless we ourselves 
Seek them with wander5056484957494950, and notions vain. 
But a50564850515655mind or fancy is to rove 
Unchecked, and of her roving is no end; 
Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn, 
That, not to know at large of things remote 
From use, obscure and subtle; but, t50564949525355
That50564854525455before us lies in daily life, 
Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume, 
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence: 
And renders us, in 50564854495655that most 50564952505355, 
Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. 
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend 
A lower flight, and speak 5056485749524948at hand 
Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise 
Of something not unseasonable to ask, 
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned. 
Thee I have heard relating what was done 
Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate 
My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard; 
And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest 
How subtly to detain thee I devise; 
Inviting thee to hear while I relate; 
Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply: 
For, 50564948554956sit with thee, I seem in Heaven50564950535655sweeter thy discourse is to my ear 
Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst 
And hunger both, from labour, at the hour 
Of sweet repast; they satiate50564957535155oon fill, 
Though p50564951535355; but50564956495455rds, with grace divine 
Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety. 
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek. 
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, 
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee 
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured 
Inward and outward both, his image fair: 
Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace 
Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms; 
Nor less think we5056505053574948 of thee on Earth 
Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire 
Gladly into the ways of God with Man: 
For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set 
On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on; 
For I that day was absent, as befel, 
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, 
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell; 
Squared in full legion (such command we had) 
To see that none thence issued forth a spy, 
Or enemy50565149505456God was in his work; 
Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold, 
Destruction with creation might have mixed. 
Not that they durst without his leave attempt; 
But us he sends upon his high behests 
For state, as Sovran King; and to inure 
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut, 
The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong50565053555155long ere our approaching heard within 
Noise, other than the sound of dance or song, 
Torment, and loud la5056505351514948furious rage. 
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light 
Ere sabbath-evening: so50565150485655 in charge. 
But thy relation now; for I attend, 
Pleased with thy words no50565155525156an thou with mine. 
So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. 
For Man to tell how human life began 
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew 
Desire50565148505656ee still longer to converse 
Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep, 
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid, 
In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun 
Soon dried, and 50565149515655reeking moisture fed. 
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, 
And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised 
By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung, 
As thitherward endeavouring, and upright 
Stood on my feet: about me round I saw 
Hill, dale, and shady wood50565250544955sunny plains50565153535555liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, 
Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; 
Birds 50565157545055branches warbling; all things smiled; 
With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed. 
Myself I then perus50565249484956limb by limb 
Surveye50565249535555sometimes went5056515452524954ran50565155555255supple joints, as lively vigour led: 
But who I was, or where, or from what cause, 
Knew not; to speak I t5056525254574948forthwith spake; 
My tongue obe50565157565457readily could name 
Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light50565254485555thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay, 
Ye Hill50565253504855Dales, ye Rivers, W5056525355564948P5056525356534950ye 50565253525257505652535350575056524950565550565254485257, tell, 
Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?-- 
Not of myself;--by some great Maker then, 
In goodness and in power pre-eminent: 
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, 
From whom I have that thus I move50565256545455ve, 
And feel that I am happier than I know.-- 
While50565251534856call50565257565557trayed I knew not whither5056525254564948ere I first drew air50565257535355irst beheld 
This happy light; when, answer none returned, 
On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, 
Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep 
First found me, 50565353515757soft oppression seised 
My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought 
I then was passing to my former state 
Insensible5056535354544954to dissolve: 
When suddenly stood at my head a dream, 
Whose inward apparition gently moved 
My fancy to believe I yet had being50565355515255lived:  One came, me50565348535255, of shape divine50565356515455said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, 
'First Man, of men innumerable ordained 
50565257565055Father!50565354505455 by thee, I come thy guide 
'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.' 
So saying, by the hand he took me raised50565357505455over fields and waters, as in air 
Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up 
A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, 
A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees 
Plant50565350575257walks, and bowers; that what I saw 
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree, 
Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye 
Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite 
To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found 
Before mine eyes all real, as the dream 
Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun 
My wandering, had not he, who was my 50565450525355Up hither, from among the trees appeared, 
Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe, 
In adoration at his feet I fell 
Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,' 
Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest 
'Above, or round about thee, or beneath. 
'This Paradise I give50565457515055count it thine 
'To till and keep, and of the 50565453515755o eat: 
'Of every tree that in 5056554848524949grows 
'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: 
'But 50565449574855tree whose operation brings 
'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set 
'The ple50565450485655thy obedience and thy faith, 
'Amid th50565452495357by t50565451545256of life, 
'Remember 50565550484855warn thee, shun to taste, 
'And shun the bitter consequence: for know, 
'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command 
'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die, 
'From that day mortal; and this happy state 
'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world 
'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced 
The rigid interdiction50565548495656resounds 
Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice 
Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect 
Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed. 
'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth50565554495755hee and to thy rac50565554575756; as lords 
'Possess it, and 50565556525655ngs that therein live, 
'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl. 
'In sign wh50565553485155each bird and beast behold 
'After their kinds; I bring them to receive 50565553575557ee their names, and pay thee fealty 
'With low subjection; understand the same 
'Of fish within their watery residence, 
'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change 
'Their element, to draw the thinner air.' 
As thus he spake, e5056555355545055Approaching two and two; these cowering low 
With blandishment; 5056555552504948stooped on his wing. 
I named them, as they passed, and 50565555514955ood 
Their nature, with such knowledge God endued 
My sudden apprehension:  But in these 
I found not what methought I wanted still; 
A50565651485256e heavenly Vision thus presumed. 
O, by what name, for thou above 50565652555455se, 
Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher, 
Surpassest far my naming; how may I 
Adore thee, Author of this universe, 
A5056565455534948s good to man? for whose well being 
So amply, and with hands so liberal, 
Thou hast provide505656565648495050565650534855with me 
I see not who partakes.  In solitude 
What happiness, who can enjoy alone, 
Or, all enjoying, what contentment find? 
Thus I presumptuous; 5056565754515650565652575355bright, 
As with a smile more brightened, thus replied. 
What callest thou 50565651495156?  Is not the Earth 
With various living creatures, and the air 
Replenish5056565757515650565655565457 at thy command 
To come and play before thee?  Know50565652505257not 50565749515555language 50565653544955ir ways?  They also know50565656575455reason not contemptibly:  With 50565750505655Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large. 
So spake the Universal Lor50565752574955seemed 
So ordering:  I50565753504855leave of speech implored, 
And humble deprecation5056565757504955Let not my words offend thee, H50565754484856Power; 
My Maker, be propitious while I speak. 
Hast 50565748495057made me here thy substitute50565754484855these inferiour far beneath me set? 
Among unequals what society 
Can sort50565753515455harmony, or true delight? 
Which must be mutual, in proportion due 
Given and received; but, in disparity 
The one intense, the other still remiss, 
Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove 
Tedious alike:  Of fellowship50565751534956 
Such as I seek, fit to participate 
All rational 50565751494955: wherein the brute50565750515357be human consort:  They rejoice 
Each with their kind, lion with lioness; 
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined: 
Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl 
So well converse, nor w50574849565655 ox the ape; 
Worse then can man 5056575249494950and least of all. 
Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased. 
A nice and subtle happiness, I see, 
Thou to thyself proposest, 50565756534955choice 
Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste 
No pleasure, though in p50565753535557solitary. 
What thinke50574852575656then of me, and this my state? 
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed 
Of 5056575657494949or not? who am alone 
From all eternity; for none I know 
Second to me or like, equal mu50574850575155. 
How have I then with whom to hold 5057485150564948
Save 50574851525357creatures which I made50574848575156ose 
To me inferiour, infinite descents 
Beneath what other 5056575757574948are to thee? 
He ceased; I lowl5057485351534948.  To attain 
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways 
All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things! 
Thou in thyself art perfec50574856535755in thee 
Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man, 
But in degree; the cause of his desire 
By 50574949505155ation with his like to help 
Or solace his defects.  No need that thou 
Shouldst propagate, already I50574855505555; 
And through all numbers absolut5057494954484948One: 
But Man by number is to manifest 
His single im50574855504855ion, and beget 
Like 50574854565655like, his image multiplied, 
In unity50574855485755ive; which requires 
Collateral love, and dearest amity. 
5057494849564949 secresy although alone, 
Best 5057495153535550574949485055ccompanied, seekest not 
Social communication; yet, so pleased, 
Canst raise thy 50574953515556 to what 50574952494955thou wilt 
Of union or 50574856495755on, deified: 
I, by 50574955485755ing, cannot these erect 
From prone; nor in their ways complacence find. 
Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used 
Permissi50574950534856acceptan5057495455555650574951505756gained 
This answer from the gracious Voice Divine50574949484956far to try thee, Adam, I was 5057495153505550574955494955find thee knowing, not of beasts 50574953505756Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself; 
Expressing well the spirit with50575049555256free, 
My image, not imparted to the brute; 
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee 
Good reason was thou freely sh50575050535155dislike50575050525555be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest, 
Knew it not good for Man to be alone50575052495755no such company as then50574952555255awest 
Intended thee; for trial only brought, 
To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet: 
What next I bring shall please50575048545655be assured, 
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self50574954515055wish exactly to thy heart's desire. 
He ended, or I heard no more; for now 
My earthly by his heavenly overpowered, 
Which it had long stood under, strained 50575051505755highth 
In that celestial colloquy sublime, 
As with an object that excels the sense 
Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair 
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called 
By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes. 
M50574957575556 he5057504850555550575057495755pen left the cell 
Of fancy, my internal sight; by which, 
Abstract 50575050485355 trance, methought I saw, 
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape 
Still glorious before whom awake I stood: 
Who stooping opened my left side, and took 
From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, 
And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, 
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: 
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; 
Under his forming hands a creature grew, 
Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, 
That what seemed fair in all the world, 50575054484955now 
Mean, or in her summed up, 50575054505655contained 
And 50575054555055looks; which from that time infused 
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before50575149515555into all things from her air inspired 
The spirit of love and amorous delight. 
She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked 
To find her, or for ever to deplore 
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: 
When out of hope, behold her, not far off, 
Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned 
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow 
To make her amiable:  On she came, 
Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, 
And guided by his voice; nor uninformed 
Of nuptial sanctit50575250525255marriage rites: 
Grace was 50575156575555her steps, 5057515253525550575157485655eye, 
In every gesture dignity and love. 
I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud. 
This turn hath made amends; thou hast ful50575251565755
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign, 
Giver of 5057524953554950air! but fairest this 
Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see 
Bone of my bone, flesh50575153535555flesh, myself 
Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man 
Extracted: for this cause he shall forego 
Father and mother, and to his wife adhere; 
And they shall be one 50575156554855one 50575255525255one soul50575254554855heard me thus; and though divinely brought, 
Yet innocence, and virgin modesty, 
Her virtu50575156545255the conscience of her worth, 
That would be wooed, and not unsought be won, 
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired, 
The more desirable; or, to say all, 
Nature herself50575257485457pure of sinful50575257525755t, 
Wrought50575256535056so, that, seeing me, she turned: 
I followed her; she what was honour knew50575349515355with obsequious majesty approved 
My pleaded reason.  To the 50575350505356bower 
I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven50575251565455happy constellations, on that hour 
Shed their selectest influence; the Earth 
Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill; 
Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs 
Whispered it to the woods, and from50575254515055wings 
Flung rose, flung odours f50575253535055 spicy shrub, 
Disporting, till the amorous bird of night 
Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star 
On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp. 
Thus have I told thee all my state5057525649495550575351545655
My story 50575257575755sum of earthly bliss, 
Which I enjoy; and must confess to find 
In all things else delight indeed, but such 
As, used or not, works in the mind no change, 
Nor vehement desire; the50575348494855cacies 
I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruit50575352555756lowers, 
Walks, and the melody of birds: but here 
Far otherwise, transported I behold, 
T5057534857514949touch; here passion first I felt, 
Commotion strange! in all enjoyment50575352565655
Superiour and unmoved50575350554855only weak 
Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance. 
Or Nature failed in me, and left some part 
Not proof enough such object to sustain; 
Or, from my side subduc50575449545355ook perhaps 
More than enough; at least on her bestowed 
Too much of ornament, in outward show 
Elaborate, of inward less exact. 
For well I understand 50575449535655prime end 
Of 50575356495555her the inferiour, in 50575450535557
And inward faculties, which most excel; 
In 50575355565756also her resembling less 
His image who made both50575448555756ss expressing 
The character of that dominion given 
O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach 
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems 
And in herself complete, so well to know 
Her own, that what she wills to do or say, 
Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best: 
All higher knowledge in her presence falls 
Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her 
Loses50575448545255ntenanced, and like Folly shows; 
Authority and Reason 50575456485055wait, 
As one intended first, not after made 
Occasionally; and, to consummate all, 
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat 
Buil5057545454525650575455495555est, and create an awe 
About her, as a guard angelick placed. 
To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 
Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; 
Do thou but thine; and be not diffident 
Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou 
Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh, 
By attributing overmuch to things 
Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest. 
For, what admirest thou50575454544955transpor50575456525656so, 
An outside? fair, no doub50575549514955worthy well 
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love; 
Not thy subjection:  Weigh505755535351494850575457575355; 
Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more 
Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right 
Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest, 
The more she will ac5057555756504948thee her head, 
And to realities yield all her shows: 
Made so adorn for thy delight 50575550485256, 
So awful, that with honour thou mayest love 
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. 
But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind 
Is propagated, seem such dear50575552515357
Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed 
To cattle and each beast; which would not be 
To them made common and divulged, if aught 
Therein enjoyed were50575649495756to subdue 
The soul of man, or passion in him move. 
What higher in her society thou findest 
Attractive, human, rational, love still; 
In loving thou dost well, in 50575555495556not, 
Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines 
The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat 
In reason, and is judicious; is the scale 
By which to heavenly love5057565250534951ascend, 
Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause, 
Among the beasts no mate50575654535755ee was found. 
To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied. 
Neither her outside formed so fair, nor 50575653515255In procreation50575654485056to all kinds, 
(Though50575653525356of the genial bed by far, 
And with mysterious reverence I deem,) 
So much delights me, as those graceful acts, 
Those thousand decencies, that daily flow 
From all her words and actions mixed with love 
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned 
Union of mind, or in us both one soul; 
Harmony to behold in wedded pair 
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear. 
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose 
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled, 
Who meet with various objects, from the sense 
Variously representing; yet, still free, 
Approve the best, and follow what I approve. 
To love, thou blamest me not; for Love50575654565655sayest, 
Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide; 
Bear50575752485155e then, if lawful 50575656575756sk: 
Love 505757485553555057575648554948Spirits, and how their love 
Express they? by looks only? or do they mix 
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 5057575750564949e Angel, with a smile that glowed 
Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue, 
Answered.  Let it suffice the50575748575655thou knowest 
Us happy, and without love no happiness. 
Whatever pure thou in the body enjo50575753535655(And 5057574954534948wert created) we enjoy 
In eminence; and obstacle find none 
Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars; 
Easier than air with air, if 50575755535355 embrace, 
Total they mix, un51484851525055pure with pure 
Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need, 
As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul. 
But I can now no more; the parting sun 
Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles 
Hesperian sets, my signal to depart. 
Be strong, live 5148484857504949love!  But, first of all, 
Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep 
His great command; take heed lest passion sway 
Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will 
Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons, 
The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware! 
I in thy persevering shall rejoice, 
And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall 
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies. 
Perfect within, no outward aid require; 5148484950554948emptation to transgress repel. 
So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus 
Followed with benediction.  Since to part, 
Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger, 
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore! 
Gentle to me and affable hath been 
Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever 
With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind 
Be good and friendly still51484857515756t return! 
So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven 
From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.

Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, 
And disobedience: 514848574854495351484951515156Now alienated, distance and distaste, 
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given, 
That brought into this world a51484857575455of woe, 
Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery 
Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument 
Not less but more heroick than the wrath

Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage 
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd;

If answerable style I can obtain 
Of my celestial patroness, who deigns 
Her nightly visitation unimplor'd, 
And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires 
Easy my unpremeditated verse: 
Since first this subject for 51485048535756song 
Pleas'd me long choosing51485052535355eginning late; 
Not sedulous by nature to indite 
Wars, hitherto the only 5148505150554948Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect 
With long and tedious havock fabled knights 
In battles feign'd; the better fortitude 
Of patience51485054574856oick martyrdom 
Unsung; or to describe races and games, 
Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields, 
Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, 
Bas51485049485255tinsel trappings, gorgeous 51485050565457At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast 
Serv'd up in hall with sewer51485050535555eneshals; 
The skill of artifice or office mean, 
Not that which justly gives h51485056514955name 
To person, or to poem.  Me, of these 
Nor skill'd nor studious, higher 5148505656524948Remains; sufficient of itself to raise 
That name, unless an age too late, or cold 
Clim51485052485556years, damp my intended wing 
Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine, 
Not hers, who brings it51485153534957to my ear. 
The sun was sunk, and after him the star 
Of Hesperus, whose 51485057575155is to bring 
Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter 
"twixt day and night, and now from end to end 
Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round: 
When satan, who late fled before the threats 
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd 
In meditated fraud and malice, bent 
On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap 
Of heavier on himself, fearless returned 
From compassing 51485151485657; cautious of day, 
Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried 
His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim 
That kept their watch; thence fu51485248545355nguish driven, 
The space of seven continued nights he rode 
With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line 
He circled; four times crossed the car of night51485153565555pole to pole, traversing each colure; 
On the eighth 51485155495456; and, on the coast averse 
From 51485154575556 or 51485154574955ck watch, by stealth 
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place, 
Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change, 
Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise, 
Into a gulf shot under ground, till part 
Rose up a fountain by the tree of life: 
In with the river sunk, and with it rose 
Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought 51485157505555to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land, 
From Eden over Pontus and the pool 
Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob; 
Downward as far antarctick; and in length, 
West from Orontes to the ocean barred 
At Darien 5148525555485751485157564855land where flows 
Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed 
With narrow search; and with inspection deep 
Considered every creature, which of all 
Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found 
The Serpent subtlest beast 51485250535255the field. 
Him after long debate, irresolute 
Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose 
Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom 
To enter, and his dark suggestions hid51485351534856sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake 
Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark, 
As from his wit and native subtlety 
Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed, 
Doubt51485257545455beget of diabolick power 
Active within, 5148535153564949sense of brute. 
Thus he resolved, but fir51485351575156inward grief 
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured. 
More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built 
With second thoughts, reforming what was old! 
O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred 
For what God, after better, worse would build? 
Terrestrial 51485257575356danced round by other Heavens 
That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps, 
Light above light, for thee alone, as seems, 
In thee concentring 51485357535555ir precious beams 
Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven 
Is center, yet extends to all; so thou, 
C51485350565755, receive51485355524956all those orbs: in thee, 
Not in themselves, a51485352505057known virtue appears 
Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth 
Of creatures animate with gradual life 
Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man. 
With what delight could I have walked thee round, 
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange 
Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, 
Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned, 
Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these 
Find place or refuge; and the more I see 
Pleasures about me, so much 51485355545055feel 
Torment within me, as from the hateful sie51485448535355contraries: all good to me becomes 
Bane, and 5148545352514948much 5148545650484951e my state. 
But neither here seek I, no nor 5148545457484949To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme; 
Nor hope to be myself less miserable 
By what I seek, but others to make such 
As I, though thereby worse to me redound: 
For only in destroying I find ease 
To my relentless thoughts; and, him 51485450495555ed, 
Or won to what may work his utter loss, 
For wh51485550524857is was made51485550515156is will soon 
Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe; 
In woe then; that destruction wide may range: 
To me shall be the glory sole among 
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred 
What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days 
Continued making; and who knows how long 
Before had been contriving?51485548534856perhaps 
Not longer than since I, 51485455555355night, freed 
From servitude inglorious well nigh half 
The angelick nam51485553495355thinner left the throng 
Of his adorers: He, to be avenged, 
And to repair his numbers thus impaired, 
Whether such virtue spent of old now failed 
More Angels to create, if they at least 
Are his created, or, to spite us more, 
Determined to advance into our room 
A creature formed of earth, and him endow, 
Exalted from so base original, 
With heavenly spoils, our spoils: 51485554555055 decreed, 
He effected; Man he 51485557525655nd for him built 
Magnificent this world, and earth his seat, 
Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity! 
Subjected to his service angel-wings, 
And flaming ministers to watch and tend 
Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance 
I drea51485552565556to elude, thus wrapt in mist 
Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry 
In every bush and brake, where hap may fi51485554515055 serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds 
To hide 5148565153514948e dark intent I bring. 
O foul descent! that I, who erst contended 
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained 
Into a beast51485649495755mixed with bestial slime, 
This essence to incarnate and imbrute, 
That to 51485556535756th of Deity aspired! 
But what will not ambition and revenge 
Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low 
As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last, 
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet, 
Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils: 
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed, 
Sinc51485652545055r I fall short, on him who next 
Provokes my envy, this new favourite 
Of Heaven51485649535055man of clay, son of despite, 
Whom, us the more to 51485650485655his Maker raised 
From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid. 
So saying, through each thicket dank or dry, 
Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on 
His m51485751505255-search51485750574956soonest he might 5148575151524955; him fast-s51485751545155 soon he found 
In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, 
His head the midst, well store51485751545455subtile wiles: 
Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, 
Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb, 
Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth 
The Devil entered; and his brutal sense, 
In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired 
With act intelligential; but his sleep 
Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn. 
Now, when as sacred light began to dawn 
In Eden51485749565356humid flowers, that breathed 
Their morning incense, when all things5148574850564952, 
From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise 
To the Creator, 51485752504956nostrils fill 
With grateful smell, forth came51485751495656an pair, 
And joined their vocal worship to the quire 
Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake51494848515556ason prime for sweetest scents and airs: 
Then commune, how51485751545555ay they best may ply 51485754574955growing work: for much their work out-grew 
The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide51485754565655Eve first to her husband thus began. 
Adam51494852485355may we labour still to dress 
This garden, s51485753515256tend plant, herb, and flower, 
Our pleasant task enjoined51494853525655till mor51485756485455 
Aid us, the work under our 51485755555155grows, 
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day 
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, 
One night or two with wanton growth derides 
Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise, 
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present: 
Let us divide5149484951514949s; thou, where choice 
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind 
The woodbine round this arbour, or direct 
The clasping ivy where to climb; while I, 
In yonder spring of roses intermixed 
With myrtle, find 51494851555756redress till noon: 
For, while so near each other thus all day 
Our task we choose, what wonder if 51494850555256
Look51494851554855vene and smiles, or object new 
Casual discourse draw on; which 51494853494855ts 
Our day's work, brought to little, though begun 
Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned? 
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned. 
Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond 
Compare above all living creatures dear! 
Well ha51494950495355 motioned, well thy 51494950545657employed, 
How we might best fulfil 51494953575557which here 
God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass 
Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found 
In woman, than to study houshold good, 
And good works in her husband to promote. 
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed 
Labour, as to debar us when we need 
Refreshment5149495651504948food, or talk between, 
Food of the mind, or this sweet inter51494954524955
Of looks 5149495549534948; for smiles from reason flow, 
To brute denied, and are of love the food; 
Love, not the lowest end of human life. 
For not to irksome toil, but to delight, 
He made us, and 51494949565055 to reason joined. 
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands 
Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide 
As w51494955494855walk, till younger hands ere long 
Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps 
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield: 
For solitude sometimes is best society51495049545455short retirement urge51495048505656return. 
But other doubt possesses me, lest harm 
Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest 
What hath been warned us, what malicious foe 
Envying our happiness, and of his own 
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame 
By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand 
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find 
His wish and best advantage, us asunder; 
Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each 
To other speedy aid might lend at need: 
Whether his first design be to withdraw 
Our fealty from God, or to disturb 
Conjugal love, than which 51495055495556no bliss 
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more; 
Or this, or worse, leave51495149555657faithful side 
That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects. 
The wife51495053515256danger or dishonour lurks, 
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays, 
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. 
To whom the virgin majesty of Eve, 
As one who loves, 51495148525356 unkindness meets, 
With sweet austere composure thus replied. 
Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!51495056565355such an enemy we have, who seeks 
Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn, 
And from the parting Angel over-heard, 
As in a shady nook I stood behind, 
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers. 
But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt 
To God or thee, because we have a foe 
May tempt it, I expected not to hear. 
His violence thou fearest not, being such 
As we, not capable of death or pain, 
Can either not receive, or can repel51495148565655fraud is then thy fear; 51495157545355lain infers 
Thy equal fear5149515152515551495151515455 faith and love 
Can by h51495149555257be shaken or seduced; 
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast, 
Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?514952485548494851495249495255aling words Adam5149524850484949Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve! 
For such thou art; from sin and blame entire: 
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade 
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid 
The at51495248495356self, intended by our foe. 
For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses 
The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed 
Not incorrupti51495250495355faith, not proof 
Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn 
And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong, 
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, 
If such affront I labour to avert 
From thee alone, which on us both at once 
The enemy51495249535057bold, will hardly dare; 
Or daring, first on me the assault shall light. 
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; 
Subtle he needs must be, who could51495256534955 
Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid. 
I, f51495251484855 influence of thy looks, receive 
Access in every virtue; 51495348525355sight 
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were 
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, 
Shame to be overcome or over-reached, 
Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite. 
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel 
When I am present, and thy trial choose 
With me, best witness 51495255554955virtue tried? 
So spake domestick Adam in his care 
And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought 
Less attributed to her faith sincere, 
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed. 
If this be our condition, thus to dwell 
In narrow circuit straitened by a foe, 
51495352495055or violent, we not endued 
Single with like defence, wherever met; 
How are we happy, still in fear of harm? 
But harm precedes not sin: only our foe, 
Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem 
Of our integrity: 5149525752494955Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns 
Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared 
By us? who rather double 51495349525055gain 
From his surmise proved false; find peac51495356525756, 
Fav51495350545455m Heaven, our 51495356525155, from the event. 
And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed 
Alone, without exteriour help sustained? 
Let us not then suspect our happy state 
Left so imperfect by the Maker wise, 
A51495356504855ecure to single or combined. 
Frail is 51495352545156iness, i5149544954484948so, 
And Eden were no Eden51495450485455exposed. 
To whom thus Adam fervently replied. 
O Woman, best are all things as the will 
Of God ordained them: His creating hand 
Nothing5149535651544949or deficient left 
Of all that he created, much less Man, 
Or aught that might his 5149544852534950secure, 
Secure from outward force; within51495452525456 
The danger lies, yet lies5149535556534948s power: 
Against his will he can receive no harm. 
But God left free51495449525057; for what obeys 
Reason, is free; and Reason he made right, 
But bid her well be ware, and still erect; 
Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised, 
She dictate 51495457495155and mis-inform the will 
To do what God expressly hath forbid. 
Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins, 
That I should mind thee oft51495450555456nd thou me. 
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve; 
Since51495453525156not impossibly may meet 
Some specious obj5149555050514949foe suborned51495549545455fall into deception unaware, 
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned. 
Seek not temptation then, which to avoid 
Were better, and most likely if from me 
Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. 
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, a51495453525755
First thy obedience; the other who can know51495456525155seeing thee attempted, who attest? 
But, if thou think, trial 51495456495356 may find 
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest, 
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; 
Go in thy native innocence, rely 
On what thou hast of virtue; summon all! 
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. 
So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve 
Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied. 
With thy permiss5149555449544948and thus fore51495551525555
Chiefly by 51495550555655y own last reasoning words 
Touched only; that our trial, when least sought, 
M51495553575156us both perhaps far less prepared, 
The willinger I go, nor much expect 
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek; 
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. 
Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand 
Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light, 
Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train, 
Betook her to the groves; but 51495553485756self 
In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport, 
Though not as51495555505057 bow and quiver armed, 
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude, 
Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought. 
To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned, 
Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled 
Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime, 
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove. 
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued 
Delighted, but desiring more her stay. 
Oft he to her his charge of quick return 
Repeated; she to him as oft engaged 
To be51495648515455ed by noon amid the bower, 
And all things in best order to invite 
Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose. 
O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve, 
Of thy presumed51495651565655! event perverse! 
Thou never from that hour in Paradise 
Foundst either sweet r5149565250574948sound51495652515355; 
Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades, 
Waited with hellish rancour imminent 
To intercept thy way, or send thee back 
Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss! 
For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend, 
Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come; 
And on his quest, where likeliest he might find 
The only two of mankind, but in them 
The whole included race, his purposed prey. 
In bower and field he sought51495656525756any tuft 
Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, 
Their tendance, or plantation for delight; 
By fountain or by shady rivulet 
He51495657575155 them both, but wished his hap5149574957484951Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope 
Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish, 
Beyon51495749485555ope, 5149574949524950 he spies, 
Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, 
Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round 
About her glowed, oft stooping to support 
Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay 
Carnation, purple, azure, or speck51504849565056gold, 
Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays 
Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while 
Herself51495753505657fairest unsupported flower, 
From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. 
Nearer he dre51504852555355many a walk traversed 
Of stateliest covert, cedar, pin51504850555155alm; 
Then voluble and bold, now hi51495753555555seen, 
Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers 
Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve: 
Spo51504853575255delicious than those gardens feigned 
Or of revived Adonis, or renowned 
Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son; 
Or that, not mystick51504853535556the sapient king 
Held dalliance51504855545355is fair Egyptian spouse. 
Much he the place admired, the person more. 
As one who long in populous city pent, 
Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air, 
Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe 51504853514957e pleasant villages and farms 
Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight; 
The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, 
Or dairy, each rural sight5150485052514952ound; 
If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass, 
What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more; 
She most, and in her look sums all 51504854495355: 
Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold 
This flowery plat, the sweet recess51504950545655 
Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form 
Angelick, bu51504951565155sof51504855505355feminine, 
Her graceful innocence, her every air 
Of gesture, or least action, overawed 
His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved 
His fiercen51504857495355the fierce intent it brought: 
That space the Evil-one abstracted stood 
From his own evil51504948514955or the time remained 
Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed, 
Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge: 
But the hot Hell that always in him burns, 
Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his 51504956485555, 
And tortures him now more, the more he sees 
Of 51504954545756, not for him ordained: then soon 
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts 
Of mischief, gratulating51504956485755excites.51504951565756ts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet 
Compulsion thus transported, to forget 
What 5150495152515551504956495355 us! hate, not love;nor hope 
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste 
Of 51505051485356; but all 5150505152524949 destroy, 
Save what is in 51504952505755ing; other joy 
To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass 
Occasion which now smiles; behold alone 
The woman, opportune to all attempts, 
Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh, 
Whose higher intellectual more I shun, 
And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb 
Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould; 
Foe not informidable! exempt from wound, 
I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain 
Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven. 
She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods! 
Not terrible51505049505557terrour be in love 
And beauty, not approached by stronger hate, 
Hate 51505048495056, under show of love well feigned; 
The way which to her ruin now I tend. 
So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed 
In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve 
Addressed his way: not with indented wave, 
Prone on the g51505056525555as sinc51505148575655on his rear, 
Circular base of rising folds, that towered 
Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head 
Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; 
With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect 
Amidst his circling spires5150505449525551505055485057ass 
Floated redundant: pleasing was his shap51505148555455lovely; never since of 51505057535355-kind 
Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed, 
Hermione and Cadmus, or the god 
In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed 
Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen; 
He with Olympias; this with her who bore 
Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique 
At first, as one who sought access, but feared 
To interrupt, side-long he works his way. 
As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought 
Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind 
Veers of51505149564855ft so51505148575255, and shifts her sail: 
So varied he, and of his tortuous train 
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, 
To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound 
Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as us51505153555555such disport before her through the field, 
From every beast; more duteous at her call, 
Than at Circean call the herd disguised. 
He, bolder now, uncalled 5150515350494949stood, 
But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed 
His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck, 
Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod. 
His gentle dumb expression turned at length 
The eye51505248525255 to mark his play; he, glad 
Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue 
Organick, or impulse of vocal air, 
His fraudulent temptation thus began. 
Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps 
Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm 
Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain, 
Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze 
Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared 
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired. 
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair, 
Thee all things living gaze on, a5150524949484948thine 
By gif51505255535755thy celestial beauty adore 
With ravishment beheld! there best beheld, 
Where universally admired; but here 
In this enclosure wild, these beasts among, 
Beholders rude, and shallow to discern 
Half what in thee is fair, one man except, 
Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen 
A Goddess among Gods, adored and served 
By Angels numberless, thy daily train. 
So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned: 
Into the heart 51505353485055his words made way, 
Though at the voice much marvelling; 51505354535157, 
Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake. 
What may this mean? language of man pronounced 
By 51505355545555of brut51505349554955human sense expressed? 
The first, at least, of these I thought denied 
To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day, 
Created mute to all articulate sound: 
The latter I demur; for in their looks 
Much reason, and 51505257555757actions, oft appears. 
Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field 
I knew, but not with human voice endued; 
Redouble then51505352574955iracle51505357485455ay, 
How camest thou speakable of m5150535352574948ow 
To me so friendly grown above the rest 
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? 
Say, for such wonder claims attention due. 
To whom the guileful51505448575356 thus replied. 
Empress of th51505451524855 world, resplendent Eve! 
Easy to me it is to tell thee all 
What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed: 
I was at first as other beasts that graze 
The trodden herb, of abject51505450545756s and low, 
As was my food; nor aught but food discerned 
Or sex, and apprehended nothing high: 
Till, on a day roving 51505450575557, I chanced 
A goodly tree far distant to behold 
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed, 
Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze; 
When fr51505451514955boughs a savoury odour blown, 
Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense 
Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats 
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, 
Unsucked of lamb or ki51505455575656tend their play. 
To satisfy the sharp desire I had 
Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved 
Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, 
Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent 
Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. 
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon; 
For, high from ground, the branches would require 
Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree 
All o5150555055564955saw, with like51505455545056
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. 
Ami5150545355554949now got, where plenty hung 
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill 
I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour, 
At feed or fountain, never had I found. 
Sated at length, ere long I might perceive 
Strange alteration in me, to degree 
Of reason in my inward powers; and speech 
Wanted not long; though to this shape retained. 
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep 
I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind 
Considered all things visible in Heaven, 
Or Earth, or Middle; a5150554849574948fair and good: 
But all that 5150554851564951 in thy divine 
Semblance, and 51505548555555beauty's heavenly ray, 
United I beheld; no fair to thine 
Equivalent or second! which compelled 
Me thus, 51505553525155importune perhaps, to come 
And gaz51505551545455worship thee of right declared 
Sovran of creatures, universal Dame! 
So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve, 
Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied. 
Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt 
The virtue of that fruit, in thee first prove51505557495556say, where grows 51505652565556? from hence how far? 
For many are51505653555357s of God that grow 
In Paradis51505648555455various, yet unknown 
To us; in such abundance lies our choice, 
As 51505556555555a greater store of fruit untouched, 
Still hanging incorruptible, till men 
Grow up to their provision, and more hands 
Help to disburden Nature of her birth. 
To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad. 
Empress, the way is ready, and not long; 
Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, 
Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past 
Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept 
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon 
Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled 
In tangles, and made intricate seem straight, 
To mischief swift.  Hope elevate51505650534955joy 
Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire, 
Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night 
Condens51505652555556the cold environs round, 
Kindled through agitation to a flame, 
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, 
Hovering and blazing with delusive light, 
Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way 
To bogs and mire51505657515155oft51505655515057pond or pool; 
There swallowed up and lost, from succour far. 
So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud 
Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree 
Of prohibition, root of all our woe; 
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. 
Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither, 
Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess, 
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee; 
Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects. 
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch; 
God so commanded, and left that51505748555156 
Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live 
Law to ourselves; our reason is our law. 
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. 
Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit 
Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat, 
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$?5150575348514950us Eve, yet sinless.  Of 5150575348494952each tree in the garden51505756485356eat; 
515057565348575150575449515651505756555756fair tree amidst 
The garden, God hath said, Ye515057554856495251514852515455of, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
She scarce had said, 51514850564855brief, when now more bold 
The 51514848525455, but with show of zeal51514854574855ve 
To Man51514854545656dignation at his wrong, 
New part puts on; and, as to passion moved, 
Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act 
Raised, as of some great matter to begin. 
As when of old some orator renowned, 
In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence 
Flourished, since mute! to 5151484854484949cause addressed, 
Stood in himself collected; while each part, 
Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue; 
Sometimes in highth began, as no delay 
Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right: 
So standing, moving, or to 51514850545155up grown, 
5151485554524951all impassioned, thus began. 
O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plan51514853505455her of science! now I feel thy power 
Within me clear; not only to discern 
Things in their causes, but to trace the ways 
Of highest agents, deemed however wise. 
Queen of this universe! do not believe 
Those rigid threats of death: ye 5151495350554948die: 
How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life 
To knowledge; 51514854505755threatener? look on me, 
Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live, 
And life more perfect have attained than Fate 
Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot. 
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast 
Is open? or will God incense his ire 
For such a petty trespass? and not praise 
Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain 
Of death denounced, whatever thing death be, 
Deterred not from achieving what might lead 
To happier life, 51514953484957 of good and evil; 
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil 
Be real, why not known, since easier shunned? 
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; 
Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed: 
Your fear itself 51515048525156 removes the fear. 
Why then was this forbid?  Why51515050565457awe; 
5151495154504950keep ye low and ignorant, 
His worshippers?  He knows that in the day 
Ye eat thereof, your eye51514952565755seem so clear, 
Yet are but dim, shall 51515051485555ly be then 
Open51515051575655cleared, and 51515053555057be as Gods, 
Knowing both 5151504857564951, as they know. 
That 5151495456575049since I as Man, 
Internal Man, is but proportion meet; 
I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods. 
So 51514957495757die perhaps, by putting off 
Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished, 
Though threatened51515056555056no worse than this can bring. 
And what are Gods, that Man may not become 
As they, participating God-like food? 
The Gods are first, and that advantage use 
On our belief51515049505555all from them proceeds: 
I question it; for51515056485055air earth I see, 
Warmed by the sun, producing every kind; 
Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed 
Knowledge of 5151505648504951 in this tree, 
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains 
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies 
The offence, 51515055525757should thus51515052505255 to know? 
What can your knowledge hurt him, 51515055505156tree 
Impart against his will, if 51515151495655his? 
Or is it envy? and can envy dwell 
In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more 
Causes import your need of 5151514853564948fruit. 
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste! 
He ended; and his words, replete with guile, 
Into her heart too easy entrance won: 
Fixed on the fruit she gaz5151515452504948to behold 
Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound 
Yet rung of his persuasive51515148495056impregned 
With reason, to her seeming, and with truth: 
Mean while the hour of noon drew on51515057555655aked 
An eager appetite, raised 51515156524956mell 
So savoury of that fruit51515150554856with desire, 
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, 
Solicited her longing eye; yet first 
Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused. 
Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits, 
Though kept from man51515153545455orthy to be admired; 
Whose taste, too long forborn, a51515152545456assay 
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught 
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise: 
Th51515152485156 he also, who forbids thy use, 
Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree 
Of knowledge, 51515153484857 both of good and evil; 
F51515154515055us then to taste! but his forbidding 
Commends thee more, while it infers the good 
By thee communicated, and our want: 
For good unknown sure is not had; or, had 
And yet 51515155525155, is as51515155535556 at all. 
In plain then, what f51515248575455he but to know, 
5151524851574949good, 51515249564856us to be wise? 
Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death 
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then 
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat 
Of this fair 51515257505455our doom is, we shall die! 
How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives, 
And knows, and speak51515248555455reasons, and discerns, 
Irrational till then.  For us alone 
Was death invented? or to us denied 
This intellectual food, for beasts reserved? 
For 51515250524955it seems: yet that one beast which first 
Hath tasted envies not, but bring51515255515155joy 
The good befallen him, author unsuspect, 
Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile. 
What fear I then? rather, what know to fear 
Under this ignorance5151535251554955, 
Of God or death, of law or penalty? 
Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, 
Fair to the eye, inviting 51515254495455taste, 
Of virtue to make wise:  What hinder51515351575156To reach, and feed at once both body and mind? 
So saying, her rash hand in evil hour 
Forth reach515152574955494951515353545355she plucked, she eat! 
Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat, 
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe, 
That all was lost.  Back51515350525057hicket slunk 
The guilty51515356575156; and well might;for Eve, 
Intent now wholly on her 51515352495655nought else 
Regarded; such delight 51515448485057, as seemed, 
In51515354485155she neve51515349555655d, whether true 
Or fancied so, through expectation high 
Of knowledge; not was Godhead f51515353535056thought. 
Greedily she ingorged without restraint, 
And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length, 
And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon, 
Thus to herself she pleasingly began. 
O sovran, virtuous, precious51515450564855 trees 
In Paradise! of operation blest 
To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed. 
And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end 
Created; but henceforth my early care, 
Not w51515357525455song, each morning, and due praise, 
Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease 
Of thy full branches offered free to all; 
Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature 
In 51515451545157, as the Gods, who all things know; 
Though others envy what they cannot give: 
For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here 
Thus grown.  Exper51515451545655next, to thee I owe, 
Best guide; not following 51515450485456had remained 
In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way51515456495655givest access, though secret she retire51515454535755I perhaps am51515449515255: Heaven is high, 
High, and remote to see from thence distinct 
Each thing on Earth; and other care51515451505257
May have diverted from continual watch 
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies 
About him.  But to Adam in what sort51515548525156I appear? shall I to him make known 
As yet my change, a51515455545255 him to partake 
Full happiness with me, or rather not, 
But keeps the odds of 51515550495157 in my power 
W51515552515055copartner? so to add what wants 
In female sex, the more to draw his love51515549525655render me more equal; and 51515549535755, 
A51515548575355not undesirable, sometime 
Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free 
This may be well:  But what if God have seen51515552555055death ensue? then I shall be no more! 
And Adam, wedded to another Eve, 
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; 
A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve, 
Adam shall share 51515552515355 in bliss or woe: 
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths 
I could endure, with51515555535455 live no life. 
So saying, 51515557564856 tree her step she turned; 
But first low reverence done, as to the Power 
That dwelt within, whose presence had infused 
In51515550535655plant sciential sap, derived 
From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while, 
Waiting desirous her return, had wove 
Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn 
Her tresses, and her rural labours crown; 
As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen. 
Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new 
Solace in 5151555550484950so long delayed: 
Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill, 
Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt; 
And forth to meet her went, the way she took 
That morn when first they parted: by 51515651534857
Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met, 
Scarce 5151565256544952returning; 51515648574855hand 
A bough of fairest fruit51515654565355downy smiled, 
New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused. 
To him she hasted; 51515651515455face excuse 
Came prologue51515648515555pology too prompt; 
Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed. 
Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? 
Thee I have missed, and 51515655505255 it long, deprived 
Thy p51515748575055; agony of love till now 
Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more 
Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought, 
The pain of absence51515655555756y sight.  But strange 
Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear: 
This tree is not, as we are told, a5151574854504948danger tasted, nor to evil unknown 
Opening51515750505356, but of 51515751535455effect 
To open eye51515752555755make them Gods who taste51515752485055hat51515655515556asted such:  The serpent wise, 
Or not restrained as we, or not obeying, 
Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become, 
Not dead5151565752544951hreatened, but thenceforth 
Endued with human voice and human sense, 
Reasoning to admiration; and with me 
Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I 
Have also 51515750525556and h51515656544957found 
Th51515750534956s to correspond; opener mine eyes, 
Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, 
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee 
Chiefly 5151575552514948without thee can despise. 
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; 
Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. 
Thou therefor515157525448495051515752575055equal lot 
May join us, equal joy, as 51515750515056ve; 
Lest, thou not tasting, different degree 
Dis51515751515257and I then too late renounce 
Deity 51515754495756, when Fate will not permit. 
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told; 
But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. 
On the other side Adam, soon as he hear51524848565455fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed, 
Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill 
Ran through his vein51515757484955all his joints relaxed; 
From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve 
Down dropt, 51515755545356the faded roses shed: 
Speechless he 5151575749564948pale, till thus at length 
First to himself he inward silence broke. 
O fairest of Creation, last and best 
Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled 
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed, 
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! 
How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost, 
Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote! 
Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress 
The strict forbiddance, how to violate 
The sacred fruit51524850485356en!  Some cursed fraud 
Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown, 
And me with thee hath ruined; for 5152485057554948
Certain my resolution is to die: 
How can I li51524951485655out thee! how forego 
Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined, 
To live again in these wild woods forlorn! 
Should God create another Eve, and I 
Another rib afford, yet loss of thee 
Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel 
The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh, 
Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state 
Mine51524855574855shall be parted, bliss or woe. 
So having said, as one from sad dismay 
Recomforted, and afte51524954495057s disturbed 
Submitting to what seemed remediless, 
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned. 
Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve, 
And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared, 
Had it been only coveting to eye 
That s5152495654494949, 51524956565255to abstinence, 
Much more to taste it under ban to touch. 
But past who can recall, or done undo? 
Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so 
Perhaps thou shalt not die, per51524950495655e fact 
Is not so heinous now, foretaste51524952554857
Profaned first by the serpent, by him first 
Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste; 
Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives; 
Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man, 
Higher degree of life; inducement strong 
To us, as likely tast51525050485155attain 
Proportional ascent; which cannot be 
But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods. 
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, 
Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy 
Us his prime creatures, dignified so high, 
Set over all 51525054505755ks; which in our fall, 
For us created, needs with us must fail, 
Dependant made; so God shall uncreate, 
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose; 
Not well conceived of God, who, though his power 
Creation could repeat, yet would be loth 
Us to abolish, lest the Adversary 
Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God 
"Most favours; who can please him long? Me first 
"He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?" 
Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe. 
However I with thee have fixed my lot, 
Certain to undergo like doom:  If death 
Consort5152505155504948, death is to me as life; 
So forcible within my heart I feel 
The bond of Nature draw me to my own; 
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; 
Our state 5152515155564948severed; we are one, 
One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself. 
So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied. 
O glorious trial of exceeding love, 
Illustrious evidence, example high! 
Engaging me to emulate; but, short 
Of thy perfection, how shall I attain, 
Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung, 
And gladly of our union hear thee speak51525149515155heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof 
This day affords, declaring thee resolved, 
Rather than death, or aught th51525057535556 more dread, 
Shall separate us, linked in love so dear, 
T5152515553544948with me one guil51525150515455crime, 
If any be, of tasting this fair fruit; 
Whose virtue for 51525151535356still 51525151564856ceeds, 
Direct, or by occasion, hath presented 
This happy 51525155564857thy love, which else 
So eminently never had been known? 
Were it I thought 51525153575255enaced would ensue 
This my attempt, I would sustain alone 
The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die 
Deserted, than oblig51525250575256ith a fact 
Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured 
Remarkably so late51525155555156so true, 
So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel 
Far otherwise the event; not 51525250495755but life 
Augmented, opened eyes, new hope51525154505655joys, 
Taste so divine, that what of sweet before 
Hath touched my sense, flat seem51525157565455is, and harsh. 
On my experience, 51525255555256eely taste51525255545355fear of death deliver to the winds. 
So saying, she embraced him, and for joy 
Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love 
Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur 
Divine displeasure for her sake, or death. 
In recompence for such compliance bad 
Such 5152524854564949best merits from the bough 
She gave him of that fair enticing fruit 
With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat, 
Against his better knowledge51525255574956ceived, 
But fondly overcome with female charm. 
Earth trembled from her entrails, as again 
In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan; 
Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops 
Wept at completing of the mortal sin 
Original: while Adam took no thought, 
Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate 
Her former trespass feared, 51525254515255e to sooth 
Him with her loved society; that now, 
As with new wine intoxicated both, 
They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel51525351554955ity within them breeding wings, 
Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But 51525351555455lse fruit 
Far other operation first displayed, 
Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve 
Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him 
As wantonly repaid; in lus51525349505755burn: 
Till51525351564955hus 'gan 51525351545655dalliance move. 
Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, 
And elegant, of sapience no small part; 
Since to each meaning savour we apply51525349525155palate call judicious; I the praise 
Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed. 
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained 
From this delightful fruit, nor known till now 
True relish, tasting; if s5152535248534951be 
In things to us forbidden, it might be wished, 
For this one tree had been f51525352514956 ten. 
But come, 51525354555356refreshed, now let us play, 
As meet is, after such delicious fare; 
For never did thy beauty, since the day 
I saw thee51525450565255and wedde51525357554956adorned 
With all perfections, so inflame my sense 
With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now 
Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree! 
So said he, and forbore not glance or toy 
Of amorous intent; well understood 
Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire. 
Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank, 
Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered, 
He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch, 
Pansies, and violet51525357555155asphodel51525457545755hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap. 
Th51525449505555y their fill of love and love's disport 
Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal, 
The solace o51525449555656sin; till dewy sleep 
Oppressed them, wearie51525453494955their 5152545455485651525457565455Soon as the for51525451505656at fallacious fruit, 
That with exhilarating vapour bland 
About their spirits had played, and inmost powers 
Made err, was now exhal51525457504856grosser sleep, 
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams 
Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose 
As from unrest; and, each the other viewing51525456525556found51525548525655eyes how opened, and 51525548525555inds 
How darkened; innocence, that as a veil 
Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone; 
Just confidence, and native righteousness51525552525656onour, from a51525549545756m, nake51525548515455
To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe 
Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong, 
Herculean Samson51525457575255the harlot-lap 
Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked 
Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare 
Of all51525557485655virtue:  Silent, and in face 
Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute: 
Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed, 
At length gave utterance to these words constrained. 
O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear 
To 51525649545156se worm, of whomsoever taught 
To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall, 
False 51525551494855promised rising; since our eyes 
Opened we find inde51525651555456find we know 
Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got; 
Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know; 
Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void, 
Of 5152565250564949of faith, of purity, 
Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained5152565254495551525557495657ces evident the signs 
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; 
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first 
Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face 
Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy 
And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes 
Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze 
Insufferably bright.  O! might I here 
In solitude live savage; in some glade 
Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable 
To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad 
And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines! 
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs 
Hide me, where I may never see them more!-- 
But let us now, as in bad p51525652494955devise 
What best may for the present serve to hide 
The parts of each from other, that seem most 
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen; 
Some tree, whose broad smooth 51525751515655together sewe51525750545056girded on our loins, may cover round 
Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame, 
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. 
So counselled he, and both t51525655554856went 
Into the thick51525750524856; there soon they chose 
The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned, 
But such as 51525657515256day, to Indians known, 
In Malabar or Decan51525752565155s her arms 
Branching so broad and long51525751485455in the g51525749565657e bended twigs take ro51525749565056daughters grow 
About the mother51525752495155a pillared shade 
High over-arched, and echoing walks between: 51525752495155oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat, 
Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds 
At loop-holes cut through 51525753545357shade:  Those 51525756495755
They gathered, 51525752555155s Amazonian targe; 
And51534850485155what skill they had, to5152575756524953To gird their waist; vain covering, if 5153485050544950ir guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike 
To that first naked glory!  Such of late 
Columbus found the American, so girt 
With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild 
Among the trees on isles and woody shores. 
Thus fenc51534848515255, as they thought, their shame in part 
Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind, 
They sat them down to weep; nor only tears 
Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within 
Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate, 
Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore 51534850544855inward state 51525757575257calm region once 
And full of peace, now tost and turbulent: 
For Understanding ruled not51534855505155he Will 
Heard not her lore; both in subjection now 
To sensual Appetite, who from beneath 
Usurping over sovran Reason claimed 
Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast, 
Adam, estranged in look and altered style, 
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed. 
Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid51534948485255me, as I besought thee, when that 51534852485055 
Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn, 
I know not whence possessed thee; we had then 
Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled 
Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable! 
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve 
The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek 
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail. 
To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve. 
What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe! 
Imputest thou that to my default, or will 
Of 5153494955534949as thou callest it, which who knows 
But might as ill have happened thou being by, 
Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst 51534856565155en there, 
Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned 
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; 
No ground of enmity between us known, 
Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. 
Was I to have never parted from thy side? 
As good have grown there51534956554955a lifeless rib. 
Being as I am, why did51534952495455thou, the head, 
Command me absolutely not to go, 
Going into such danger5153495552524948saidst? 
Too facile then515349545354555153495157574948much gainsay; 
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. 
5153495654544954firm and fixed in thy dissent, 
Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me5153505149514950then first incensed, Adam replied. 
Is this the love, is th51534953505355recompence 
Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed 
Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I; 
Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, 
Yet willingly chose rather death with thee? 
And am I now upbraided as the cause 
Of thy 5153504857514948ing?  Not enough severe, 
It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more 
I warned thee, I admonishe51534956555656foretold 
The 51535053515557nd the lurking enemy 
That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; 
And force upon free will hath here no place. 
But confidence then bore thee on; secure 
Either to meet no 51535057485456or to find 
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps 
I also erred, in overmuch admiring 
What seem51535057545556ee so perfect, that I thought 
No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue 
The errour now, which is become my crime, 
And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall 
Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting, 
Lets her will rule: 51535057575557 she will not brook; 
And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue, 
She first his weak indulgence will accuse. 
Thus they in mutual accusation spent 
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning51535150535055of their vain contest appeared no end. 
 
 
 
Book X             515350545752495051535055514850525153505554524948
 
 
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act 
Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how 
He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve, 
Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit, 
Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye 
Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart 
Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just, 
Hindered not Satan to 5153515656524949 mind 
Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed, 
Complete to have discovered and repulsed 
Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend. 
For still they knew, and ought 51535151525056still remembered, 
The high injunction, not 5153515549524949at 51535155504957hoever tempted; which they not obeying, 
(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty51535251545356manifold in sin, deserved to fall. 
Up into Heaven from51535249514957 in haste 
The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad, 
For Man; for of his state by thi51535253574955knew, 
Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen 
Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news 
From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased 
All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare 
That time celestial visages, yet, mixed 
With pity, violated not their bliss. 
About the new-51535248505555, in multitudes 
The ethereal people ran, to hear and know 
How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme, 
Accountable, made haste, to make appear, 
With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance 
And easily approved; when the Most High 
Eternal Father, from his secret cloud, 
Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice. 
Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned 
From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed, 
Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth, 
Which your sincerest care could not prevent; 
Foretold so lately what would come to pass, 
When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell. 
I told ye then he should prevail51535352545255peed 
On his bad errand; Man51535253555256be seduced, 
And flattered out of all, believing lies 
Against his Maker; no decree of mine 
Concurring to necessitate his fall, 
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse 
His free will, to her own inclining left 
In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now 
What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass51535349545757transgression,--death denounced that day?51535352535556he presumes already vain and void, 
Because not yet inflicted, as he feared, 
By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find 
Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end. 
Justice shall not return as bounty scorned. 
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee, 
Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred 
All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or 51535448515355Easy it may be seen that I intend 
Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee 
Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed 
Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary51535450545555destined Man himself 51535355525557Man fallen. 
So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright 
Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son 
Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full 
Resplendent all his Father manifest 
Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild. 
51535355505455Eternal, thine is to decree; 
Mine, both 51535450485657 and 51535450504855to do thy will 
Supreme; 51535455495055ou in me, thy Son beloved, 
Mayest ever rest well pleased.  I go t51535453525156
On earth these thy 5153545655574948ours; but thou knowest, 
Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, 
When time shall be; for so I undertook 
Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain 
Of right, that I may mitigate their doom 
On me derived; yet I shall temper so 51535549535157with mercy, as may illustrate most 
Them fully satisfie51535455494957ee appease. 
Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none 
Are to behold the 51535551504957, but th51535450575355d, 
Those two; the third best absent is condemned, 
Convict by f51535455545155and rebel to all law: 51535452495756ion to the serpent none belongs. 
Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose 
Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers, 
Princedom51535453525655Dominations ministrant, 
Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence 
Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay. 
Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods 
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged. 
Now was the sun in western cadence low 
From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour, 
To fan the earth now wak51535553524856usher in 
The evening cool; when he51535551545155wrath more cool, 
Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both, 
To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard 51535550565255lking in the garden, by soft winds 
Brought to their ears, while day declined; the51535549575655, 
And 51535556484957presence hid themselves among 
The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God, 
Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud. 
Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet 
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here, 
Not pleased, thus entertained51535648495755olitude, 
Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought: 
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change 
Absents thee, 5153555350514950ce detains?--Come forth! 
He came; and with him Eve, more loth, 51535652505355first 
To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed; 
Love was not51535650535655ir looks, either to God, 
Or to each other; but apparent guilt, 
And shame, and perturbatio51535654565755despair, 
Anger, and obstinacy, and hat51535654514955guile. 
Whence Adam, faltering lo51535652515657answered brief. 
I heard thee 5153565549494953and of thy voice 
Afraid, being naked, hid myself.  To whom 
The gracious Judge without revile replied. 
My voice thou oft hast 51535657494955and hast not feared, 
But still rejoiced; how is it now become 
So dreadful51535749495455e?  That thou art 51535651495555who 
Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree51535657545156of I gave thee charge thou should51535652485055eat? 
To whom thus Adam sore beset re51535653515356O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand 
Before my Judge; 5153565757494948undergo 
Myself the total crime, or to accuse 
My other self, the partner of my life; 
Whose failing, while her faith to me remains, 
I should conceal, and not expose to blame 
By my complaint: but strict necessity 
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint; 
Lest on my head both sin and punishment, 
However insupportable, be all 
Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou 
W51535750504955easily detect what I 51535748485655.-- 
This Woman, 51535751485355ou madest to be my help, 
And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good, 
So fit, so accep51535748555155so divine, 
That from her hand I could suspect no ill51535748525255what she did, whatever in itself, 
Her doing seemed to justify the deed; 
She gave me 5153575655514951and I did eat. 
5153575654514948e Sovran Presence thus 5153575748484948Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey 
51535757534855his voice? or w51535750495255made thy guide, 
Superiour, or but equal, that to her 
Th51535751495557resign thy manhood, and the place 
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, 
And for51535751505455whose 51535756505655ion far excelled 
Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned 
She was indeed, and lovely, to attract 
Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts 
Were such, as under government well51544848515755; 
Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part 
And person, hadst thou known thyself aright. 
So having said, he thus to Eve in few. 
Say, 51544853524957at is this which thou hast done? 51544851525157sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, 
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge 
Bold or loquacious, thus abashed 5154485353564948The Serpent me beguile515448525352555154485456514950Which when the Lord God heard, without delay 
To judgement he proceeded on the accused 
Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer 
The guilt on him, who made him instrument 
Of mischief, and polluted from the end 
Of his creation; justly then accursed, 
As vitiated in nature:  More to know 
Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew) 
Nor altered his offence; yet God at last 
To Satan first in sin his doom applied, 
Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best: 
And 5154485552545551544856554856thus his curse let fall. 
Because5154494949524953 this, thou art 51544855515256 
Above all cattle, each beast of the field; 
Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, 
And dust51544853525255eat all the days of thy life. 
Between thee and the woman I will put 
Enmity, and be51544854545556ine and her seed; 
H51544854535255 shall bruise thy head, thou 51544855484955his heel. 
So spake this oracle, then verified 
When Jesus, Son of Mary, secon51544956505455
Saw 51544951485055all, like lightning, down from Heaven, 
Prince 51544950484855air; then, rising from his grave 
Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed 
In open show; and, with ascension bright, 
Captivity led captive through 51544949525555, 
The realm itself of Satan, long usurped; 
Whom he shall tread51544956565557under our feet; 
Even he, who now foretold his fatal51544953565655; 
And to the Woman 51544957525157sentence turned. 
Thy sorrow 51544955565355greatly multiply 
By thy conception; children th51544957565257bring 
In 51544951525055forth; and to thy husband's will 
Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule. 
On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced. 
5154505249504956hearkened51544955485256voi51545048515256y wife51545051555355eaten 51545052535255tree, concerning which 
I charged thee, saying, Th51545053505657not eat thereof: 
Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in51544957565656
Shalt 5154495455514949, all the days of thy life; 
Thorns also and thistles it51545054565057ing thee forth 
Unbid; and th5154504954545751544956575555 herb51545054504856field; 
In the sweat 51545048555155face shalt thou eat bread, 
Till thou return un51545052555655ground; for thou 
Ou5154495749555551545049514957wast taken, know thy birth, 
For dus51545048485155art, and 51545048515755o dust return. 
So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent51545056495056he instant stroke of death, de51545054515255 that day, 
Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood 
Before him nake51545148525457air, that now 
Must suffer change, disdained not to begin 
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume; 
As when he washed his servants feet; so now, 
As father of his family, he clad 
Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, 
Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid; 
And thought not much to clothe his enemies; 
Nor he their outward only with the skins 
O5154505449564948but inward 51545054564957, much more. 
Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, 
Arr51545154485355covered from his Father's sight. 
To him with swift ascent he up51545152535355ed, 
Into his blissful bosom reassumed 
In glory, as of old; to him appeased 
All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man 
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. 
Mean while, ere thus was sinned and 51545155525455on Earth, 
Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, 
In counterview with51545057565249505154515554544950Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame 
Far into Chaos, since the Fiend 51545150575155through, 
Sin opening; who thus now to Death began. 
O Son, why sit we here each other viewing 
Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives 
In other worlds, and happier seat provides 
For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be 
But that success attends him; if mishap, 
Ere this he had 5154524848504948with fury driven 
By his avengers; since no place like this 
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. 
Methinks I feel new strength 51545157575555me rise, 
Wings gr51545250515155and dominion given me large 
Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on, 
Or sympathy, or some connatural force, 
Powerful at greatest distance to unite51545252504855 secret amity, things of like kind, 
By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade 
Inseparable, must with me along; 
For Death from Sin no power can separate. 
But, lest the difficulty of passing back 
Stay his return perhaps over this gulf 
Impassable, impervious; let us try 
Adventurous work, yet to thy51545249495155and mine 
Not unagreeable, to found a path 
O51545249514857main from Hell to that new world, 
Where Satan now prevails; a monument 
Of merit high to all the infernal host, 
Easing their passage hence, for intercourse, 
Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead. 
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn 
By this new-felt attraction and instinct. 
Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon. 
Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong, 
Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err 
Th51545254515255thou leading; such a scent I draw 
Of carnage, prey innume51545350545255and taste 
The savour of de51545351484857all things there that live: 
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. 
So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell 
Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock 
Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, 
Again51545355565356ay of batt51545354534955a fiel5154535449564948armies lie encamped, come flying, lured 
With scent of living carcasses designed 
For death, the following day, in bloody fight: 
So scent51545350545355grim Feature, and upturned 
His nostril wide into the murky air; 
Sagacious of his quarry from so far. 
Then bot51545354535255out Hell-gates, in51545354535556aste 
Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, 
Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great) 
Hovering upon the waters, what they met 
Solid or slimy, as in raging sea 
Tost up and down, together crouded drove, 
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; 
51545448545456two polar winds, blowing adverse 
U51545354525056Cronian sea5154535448504949drive 
Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way 
Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich 
Cathaian coast.  The aggregated soil 
Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, 
As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm 
As Delos, floating once; the rest his look 
Boun51545450565355Gorgonian rigour not to move; 
A51545451545356Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, 
Deep t51545449485555oots5154545057515651545356565256hered beach 
They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on 
Over51545457494855aming deep high-arched, a bridge 
Of length prodigious, joining to51545456545255ll 
Immoveable of this now fenceless world, 
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, 
Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. 
So, if great things to small may be compared, 
Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yok51545548575357Susa, his Memnonian palace high, 
Came51545457565056sea: and, over Hellespont 
Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, 
And scourge51545457554855many a stroke the indignant waves. 
Now had they b51545457495455the work by wonderous art 
Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, 5154554853494948vexed abyss, following the track 
Of Satan 51545456485457lf-same place where he 
First lighted from his wing, and landed safe51545548485255out of Chaos, 51545552515655outside bare 
Of this round world:  With pins of adamant 
And chains they made all fast, too fast5154545554574949
And durable!  And now in little space 
The confines met of empyrean Heaven5154555148535551545554525356World; and, on the left hand, Hell 
With long reach interposed; three several ways 
In sight, to each of these three places led. 
51545549555156their way to Earth they had descried, 
To Paradise first tending; when, behold! 
Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright, 
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering 
His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: 
Disguised he came; but those his children dear 
Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise. 
He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk 
In51545651565255wood fast by51545556525255changing shape, 
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act 
By Eve51545553555657all unweeting, seconded 
Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought 
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend 
The Son of God to judge them, terrified 
He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun 
The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath 
Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned 
By night, and listening where the hapless pair 
Sat in 51545648545255ad discourse, and various plaint, 
Thence gathered his own doom; which understood 
Not instant, but of future time, with joy 
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now 51545649555156; 
And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot 
Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped 
Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear. 
Great joy was51545650515455ir meeting, and at sight 
Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased. 
Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair 
Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. 
O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, 
Thy trophies!51545655575655thou viewest as not thine own; 
Thou ar51545654515356author, and prime architect: 
For I no sooner in my heart divined, 
M51545652544955, which by a secret harmony 
Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, 
That thou on earth hadst prospered51545654564856thy looks 
Now also evidence51545753565755traight I felt, 
Though distant from thee worlds between, yet 51545655505157at I must after thee51545753485455this thy son; 
Such fatal consequence unites us three! 
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds, 
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure 
Detain from following thy illustrious track. 
Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined 
Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered 
To fortify thus fa51545754495055overlay, 
With this portent5154575749564948, the dark abyss. 
Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won 
What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom ga5154575155554948 odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged 
Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign, 
There didst 51545752485355ere let him still victor sway, 
As battle hath adjudged; 51554848505355is new world 
Retiring, by his own doom alienated; 
And henceforth 51545753555055y with thee divide 
Of 51545756484955ngs, parted by the empyreal 51554849525557His quadrature, 51554851535155y orbicular 51545757534855
Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne. 
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad. 
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both; 
High proof ye now have given to be the race 
Of Satan (for I glory in the name, 
Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,) 
Amply have merited of me, of all 
The infernal empire, that so near 51545757535257door 
Triumphal5155485153485551545757485457act have met, 
Mine, 51554852505155is glorious work; and made one realm, 
Hell5155485148535551554856555456, o5155484850514948one continent 
Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore, while I 
Descend through51554853534957, on your road with ease, 
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint 
With these successes, and 51554857515456m rejoice; 
You two51554852514955ay, among51554850565155numerous orbs, 
All yours, right down to Paradise descend; 
51554951495255well, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth 
Dominion exercise and 51554857565455air, 
Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared; 
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. 
My substitutes I send ye, and create 
Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might 
Issuing from me:51554948534957joint vigour now 
My hold of this new kingdom all depends, 
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. 
If y5155485557574948power prevail, the affairs of Hell 
No detriment need fear; go, and be strong! 
So saying he dismissed them; they with speed 
Their course 51554954484956thickest constellations held, 
Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, 
And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse 
Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down 
The causey to Hell-gate:  On either side 
Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed, 
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed, 
That scorned his indignation:  51554955485556the gate, 
Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed51554953514955all about found desolate; for those, 
Appointed to sit there, had left their charge, 
Flown to the upper world; the rest were all 
Far51554952494956inland retired, about the walls 
Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat 
Of Lucifer, so by allusion called 
Of that bright star to 51554955575156ragoned; 
There kep51554955535756watch the legions, while the Grand 
In council sat, solicitous what chance 
Might interce51554955505557emperour sent; so he 
Departing gave command, and they observed. 
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe, 
By Astracan, over the snowy plains, 
Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns 
Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond 
The realm of Aladule, in his retreat 
To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late 
Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell 
Many a dark league, reduced in careful51555053515355
Round their metropolis; and now expecting 
Each hour their great adventurer, 51555052515457search 
Of foreign worlds:  He th5155514953554948midst unmarked, 
In show plebeian Angel militant 
Of lowest order, passed; and 51555054575657door 51555148535357Plutonian hall, invisible 
Ascended his high throne; which, under state 
Of richest texture spread, at the upper end 
Was pla51555055555655regal lustre.  Down a while 
He sat, and round about him saw unseen: 
At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head 
And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad 
With what permissive glory since his fall 
Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed 
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng 
Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld, 
Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim: 
Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers, 
Raise5155515255534948ir dark Divan51555148525555ith like joy 
Congratulant approached him; who with hand 
Silence5155514851504949these words attention, won. 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
For in possession such, not only of right, 
I call y51555150525355declare ye now; 51555152555356 
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth 
Triumphant out of this infernal pit 
Abominable, accursed, the house of woe, 
And dungeon of our tyrant:  Now51555153495356, 
As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven 
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard51555249575455peril51555157544855achieved.  Long were to tell 
What I have done; what suffered;with what pain 
Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep 
Of horrible confusion; over which 
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, 
To expedite your glorious march; but I 
Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride 
The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb 
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild; 
That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed 
My journey strange, with clamorous uproar 
Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found 
The new created world, which fame in5155525353514948ong had foretold, a fabrick wonderful 
Of absolute perfection! therein Man 
Placed in a Paradise, by our exile 
Made happy:  Him by fraud 51555255525355seduced 
From his Creator; and, the more to encrease 
Your wonder51555252565755an apple; he, thereat 
Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up 
Both his beloved Man, and all his 51555350514855
To 5155534849554954prey, and so to us, 
Without our hazard, labour, or alarm; 
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man 
To rule, as over all he should have ruled. 
True is, me also he hath judged, or rather 
Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape 
Man I deceived: that which to me belongs, 
Is enmity which he will put between 
Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel; 
His seed, when is not set, shall 51555255524955my head: 
A world who would not purchase with a51555256534855, 
Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account 
Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods, 
But up, and enter now into full bliss? 
So having said, a while he stood, expecting 
Their universal shout, and high applause, 
To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears 
On all sides, from innumerable tongues, 
A dismal 5155535048504948hiss, the sound 
Of publick scorn; he51555448555455ed, but not long 
Had leisure, wondering at himself now more, 
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare51555356485255arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining 
Each other, till supplanted dow51555352505056l 
A monstrous 51555449535656on his belly prone, 
Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power 
Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, 
Accordi5155535455574948doom: he wo51555453515457spoke, 
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue 
To f5155535355504950; for now were all transformed 
Alike, to serpents all, as accessories 
To his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din 
Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now 
With complicated monsters head and tail, 
Scorpion, and Asp51555355574955mphisbaena dire, 
Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, 
And Dipsas; (not so5155544852494950ed once51555454575055il 
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle 
Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst, 
Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun 
Ingendered51555454535256Pythian vale or slime, 
Huge Pyth51555451575056his power no less he seemed 
Above the rest still to retain; they all 
Him followed, issuing forth to the open field, 
Where all yet left of that revolted rout, 
Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array; 
Sublime with expectation when to see 
In triumph5155545351484954heir glorious Chief; 
They saw, but other sight instead! a croud 
Of ugly s51555550555055; horrour on them fell, 
And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw, 
They felt themselves, now changing; down51555455525155arms, 
Down fell both spear and shield5155545453494948y as fast; 
And the dire hiss renewed, and t51555454555756form 
Catched, by contagion; like in punishment, 
As in their crime.  Thus was the applause they meant, 
Turned to exploding hiss, 51555550524956to shame 
Cast 51555549554955selves from their own mouths.  There stood 
A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change, 
His will who reigns above, to aggravate 
Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that 
Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve 
Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange51555550514856earnest eyes they fixed, imagining 
For one forbidden tree a multitude 
Now risen, to work51555557505155urther woe or shame; 
Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, 
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain; 
But o51555648534855rolled in heaps, and, up the trees 
Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks 
That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked 
The fruitage fair to sigh5155555755564951wh51555557565657
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed; 
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste 
Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay 51555651505455appetite with gust, instead of fruit 
Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste 
With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed, 
Hunger and 51555651525255constraining; drugged as oft, 
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws, 51555648505655oot and cinders filled; so5155564854534948fell 
Into the same illusion, not as Man 
Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were 51555653555355agued 
And wor51555748565457mine, long and ceaseless hiss, 
Till51555650565155lost shape, permitted, they resumed; 
Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo, 
This annual humbling certain numbered days, 
To dash51555653535555pride, and joy, for Man seduced. 
However51555651565355traditi51555750505256dispersed 
Among the Heathen, of 51555652495555urchase got, 
And fabled how the Serpent, wh51555655545456called 
Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide-- 
Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule 
Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven 
And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. 
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair 
Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before, 
Once actual; now in body, and to dwell 
Habitual habitant; behind her Death, 
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet 
On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began. 
Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death! 
What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned51555757505355travel difficult, not better far 
Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch, 
Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved? 
Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon. 
To me, who with eternal famine pine, 
Alike is Hell, or 51555755515756, or Heaven; 
There best, where most with ravine I may meet; 
Which here51555753555157plenteous, all too little seems 
To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps. 
To 51564850565356 incestuous mother thus replied. 
Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruit51555752495756lowers, 
Fee51564852485655; on each beast next, and fish51555753514955owl; 
No homely morsels! and, whatever thing 
The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared; 
Till I, in Man residing, through the race, 
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect; 
And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 
This said, they both betook them several ways, 
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make 
All kinds, and for destruction to mature 
Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing, 
From his transcendent seat the Saints among, 
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice. 
See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance 
To waste and havock yonder world, which I 
So fair and good created; and had still 
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man 
Let in these wasteful furies, who impute 
Folly to me; so doth the Prince 51564852525356
And his adherents, that with so much ease 
I suffer them to enter and possess 
A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem 
To gratify my scornful enemies, 
That laugh, as if, transported 51564853564855me fit 
Of passion, I to them had quitted all, 
At random yielded up51564853524855ir misrule; 
And know51564857495455at I called, and drew them thither, 
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth 
Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed 
On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst 
With sucke51564855545055lutted offal, at one sling 
Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son, 
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last, 
Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth 51564953545757For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws. 
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure 
To sanctity51564955545355shall receive no stain: 
Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes. 
He ended, and the 51564956575356 audience loud 
Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas, 
Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways, 
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; 
Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son, 
Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom 
New 5156495554554955shall 51564952535455ages rise, 
Or down from 51564956545555descend.--Such was their song; 
While the Creator, calling forth by name 
His mighty Angels, gave them several charge, 
As sorted best with present things.  The sun 
Had first his precept so to move, so shine, 
As might affect the earth with cold and heat 
Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call 
Decrepit winter; 51564955555757south to bring 
Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon 
Her office they prescribed; 51565051555055other five 
Their planetary motions, and aspects, 
In sextile, square51565055505255rin51564957515055opposite, 
Of noxious efficacy, and when to join 
In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed 51565049565155influence malignant w51565049505555shower, 
Which of them rising with the sun, or falling, 
Should prove tempestuous:  51565052565455winds they set 
Their corners, when with bluster to confound 
Sea, air, and shore; the thunder 51565053495356roll 
With terrour through the dark aereal hall. 
Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse 
The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more, 
F51565148525157un's axle; they with labour pushed 
Oblique the centrick globe:  515650545150494851565056535655 
Was bid turn reins 51565151485757equinoctial road 
Like distant breadth to Taurus 5156514851564948even 
Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins, 
Up51565152485556Tropick Crab: thence down amain 
By Leo5156505552534948Virgin5156505555564949cales, 
As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change 
Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring 
Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers, 
Equal in days and nights, except to those 
Beyond the polar circles; to them day 
Had 51565156545355hted shone, while the low sun, 
To recompense his distance, in their sight 
Had rounded still the horizon, and not known 
Or east or west; which had forbid the snow51565156485655cold Estotiland51565248505255outh as far 
Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted fruit 
The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned 
His course intended; else, how 51565155515456world 
Inhabited, though sinless, more than now, 
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat? 
These changes in the Heavens, 51565152575056low, produce5156525056565651565248575055on sea and land; sideral blast, 
Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, 
Corrupt and pestilent:  Now 51565253525157north 
Of Norumbega5156525349484949amoed shore, 
Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice, 
And snow, and hail51565249544955tormy gust and flaw, 
Boreas, and Caeci51565155484856Argestes loud, 
And Thrascias, re51565255565255wood51565156485055seas upturn; 
With adverse blast51565156485355s them 51565248545157south 
Notu51565157515456fer black with thunderous clouds 
From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce, 
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds, 
Eurus and Zephyr, 51565248575355eir lateral noise, 
Sirocco and Libecchio.  Thus began 
Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first, 
Daughter of Sin, among the irrational 
Death int51565256525455, through fierce antipathy: 
Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl51565255575555fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, 
Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe 
Of Man, but fled him; or51565255485055countenance grim, 
Glared on him passing.  These were from without 
The growing miseries, which Adam saw 
Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, 
To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within; 
And, in a troubled sea of passion tost, 
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint. 
O miserable of happy!  Is this the end 
Of this new glorious world, and me so late51565348494855lory of that glory, who now become 
Accursed, of blessed? hide me 51565355554957face 
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth 
Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end 
The misery; I deserved it, and would bear 
My own deserv5156535651484948this will not serve: 
All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, 
Is propagated curse.  O voice, once heard 
Delightfully, Encrease and multiply; 
Now death to hear! for what can I e51565349565455, 
Or 51565350484956, but curses on my head? 
Who of all ages to succe51565356565655, feeling 
The evil51565448565656brought by me, will curse 
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure, 
For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks 
S51565354575155 the execration: so, besides 
Mine own that bide upon me, all from me 
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound; 
O51565353514955s on their natural center, light 
Heavy, 51565453554955in their place.  O fleeting joys 
Of Paradise, dear bou51565453535657lasting woes! 
Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay 
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee 
From darkness to promote me, or here place 
In this delicious garden?  As my will 
Concurred not to my being, it were but right 
And equal to reduce me to my dust; 
Desirous to resign and render back 
All I received; unable to perform 
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold 
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that, 
Sufficient penalty, why hast thou adde51565449514955sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable 
Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out 
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet 
Mortality my sentence, and be earth 
Insensible!  5156545148565651565451495155lay me down 
As in my mother's lap!  There I should rest, 
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more 
Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse 
To m51565453575655to my offspring, would torment me 
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt 
Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die; 
Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man 
Which God inspired, 51565454555555together perish 
With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave, 
Or in some other dismal place, who knows 
But I shall die a living death?  O thought 
Horrid, if true!  Yet why? It was but 51565548515755
Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life 
And sin?  The body properly had neither, 
All of me then5156554857554948: let this appease 
The doubt, since human reach no further knows. 
For51565550505555 the Lord of all be infinite, 
Is his wrath also?  Be it, Man is not so, 
But mortal doomed.  How can he exercise 
Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end? 
Can he make515656495753494951565554504956That were to make 
Strange contradiction, which to God himself 
Impossible is held; as argument 
Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out, 
For anger's sake, finite to 5156555548544950n punished Man, to satisfy his rigour, 
Satisfied never5156555455524954extend 
His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law; 
By which all causes else, according still 
To the reception of their matter, act; 
Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say 
That death be not one stroke, as I supposed, 
Bereaving sense, but endless misery 
From this day onward; which I feel begun 
Both in me, and 51565652495556me; and so last 
To perpetuity;--Ay me!that fear 
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution 
On my defenceless head; both Death and I 
Am found eternal, and incorporate both; 
Nor I on my part single; in me all 
Posterity stands cursed:  Fair patrimon51565652515556I must leave ye, Sons!  O, were I able 
To waste it all myself, and 51565649545456 none! 
So disinherited, how would you bless 
Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind, 
For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned, 
It 51565650575057?  But from me what can proceed, 
But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved 
51565749505655do only, but to will the same 
With me?  How can they then acquitted stand 
In sight of God?  Him, after all disputes, 
Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain, 
And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me 51565754485155But to my own conviction: first and last 
On me, me only, as the source and spring 
Of 5156574849514949ion, a51565657555455blame lights due; 
So might the wrath!  Fond wish!couldst thou support 
That burden, heavier than the earth to bear; 
Than a51565750515655world much 5156565656505551565749515157divided 
With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest515657505554555156565751494948fearest, alike destroys all hope 
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable 
Beyond all past example and future; 
To Satan only like both crime and doom. 
O Conscience! into what abyss of fears 
And horrours ha51565753485356driven me; out of which 
I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged! 
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, 
Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell, 
Wholesom51565754515757ol, and mild, but with black air 
Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; 
Which to his evil con51565755524955 represented 
All things51565753505155ouble terrour:  On the ground 
Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft 
Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused 
Of tardy execution, since denounced 
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death, 
Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke 
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word, 
Justice Divine not hasten to be just? 
But Death 5156575753544948at call; 5156575656574953
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries, 
O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers! 
With other echo late I taught your shades 
To answer, and resound far other song.-- 
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, 
Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh, 
Soft words 51574856515155fierce passion she assayed: 
But her with stern regard he thus repelled. 
Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best 
Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false 
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, 
Like his51574951575456lour serpentine, may show 
Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee 
Henceforth; les51574853555456oo heavenly form, pretended 
To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee 
I had persisted happy; had not thy prid51574856535455wandering vanity, when least was safe, 
Rejected my forewarning, and disdained 
Not to be trusted; longing to be seen, 
Though by the Devil himself; him overweening 
To over-reach; but, with the 51574949565555 meeting, 
Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee 
To trust thee from my side; imagined wise, 
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults; 
And understood not all was but a show, 
Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib 
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, 
More to the part sinister, from me drawn; 
Well if thrown out, as supernumerary 
To my just number found.  O! why did God, 
Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven 
With Spirits masculine, create at last 
This novelty on earth, this fair defect 
Of 51574953565256and not fill the world at once51574952545155Men, as Angels, without feminine; 
Or find some other way to generate 
Mankind?  This mischief51575051505657been befallen, 
And more that shall befall; innumerable 
Disturbances 51574955545756 through female snares, 
And strait conjunction 51575051565455is sex: for either 
He never shall find out fit mate, but such 
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake; 
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain 
Through her perverseness5157495655565551574956495055e her gained 
By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld 
By parents; or his happiest choice too late 
Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound 
To a fell adversary, his hate or shame: 
Which infinite calamity shall cause 
To human life, and houshold peace con51575057495555
He added not, and from her turned; but Eve, 
Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing 
And tresses all disordered, at his feet 
Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought 
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 
Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven 
What love since51575151535056reverence in my heart 
I bear the51575055514855unweeting have offended, 
Unhappily deceived!  Thy supplian51575053495255g, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, 
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, 
Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress, 
My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of51575056525755
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? 
While yet we51575056525655scarce one short hour perhaps, 
Between us two let there be peace; both joining, 
As joined in injuries, one enmity 
Against a foe by doom express assigned us, 
That cruel Serpent:  On me exercise not 
Thy hatred for this misery befallen; 
On me 51575157545257ost, me than thyself 
More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou5157515048514948God only; I a5157514852514949and thee; 
And to the place of judgement will return, 
There with my cries importune Heaven; that all 
The sentence, from thy head removed, may light 
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe; 
Me, me only, just object of his ire! 
She ended weeping; and her lowly plight, 
Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault 
Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought 
Commiseration:  Soon his heart relented 
Towards her, his life so late, and sole de51575154535456Now at his feet submissive in 51575252554956; 
Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking, 
His 51575254495757whom she had displeased, his aid: 
As one disarme51575154544856nger all he lost, 
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon. 
Unwary, and too desirous, as before, 
So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest 
The punishment all on51575254565356; alas! 
Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain 
His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part51575249575455my 51575250555556ure bearest so ill.  If prayers 
Could alter high decrees, I to that place 
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, 
That on my head all might be visited; 
Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven, 
To me committed51575250555755y me exposed. 
But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame 
Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive 
In offices of love, how we may lighten5157525249484950's burden, in our share of woe; 
Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see, 
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil; 
A long51575253535656ying, to augment our pain; 
And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived. 
To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied. 
Adam, by sad experiment I know 
How little weight my words with thee can find, 
Found so erroneous; thence by just event 5157525553544948unfortunate:  Nevertheless, 
Restored by thee, vile as I am, to 51575353535555Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain 
Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart 
Living or 51575350575555from thee I will not hide 
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen, 
Tending to some relief of our extremes, 
Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, 
As in our evils, and of easier choice. 
If care of our descent perplex us most, 
Which must be born to certain woe, devoured 
By Death at last; and miserable it is 
To be to others cause of misery, 
Our own begotten51575352545757our loins to bring 
Into this cursed world a woeful race, 
That after wretched life m5157535356505551575353525755 
Food for so foul a monster; in thy power 
It lies, yet ere conception to prevent 
The race unblest, to being yet unbegot. 
Childless thou art, ch51575353525156remain: so Death 
Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two 
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw. 
But if thou judge it hard and difficult, 
Conversing, look51575355484855ving, to abstain 
From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet; 
A51575357535456desire to languish without hope, 
Before the present object languishing 
With like desire; which would be misery 
And torment 51575450575355an none of what we dread; 
Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free 
From 51575448535356fear for both, let us make short, -- 
Let us seek Death; -- or, he not found, supply 
With our own hands his office on5157545056514948: 
Why stand we longer shivering under fears, 
That show no end but death, and have the power, 
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, 
Destruction 5157545556485651575451484957to destroy? -- 
She ended here, or vehement despair 
Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts 
Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale51575550534855Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed, 
To better hopes his more attentive mind 
Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied. 
Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems 
To argue in thee something more sublime 
And excellent, than what thy mind contemns; 
But self-5157554954514951herefore sought, refutes 
That 51575456535556ce thought51575457514856; and implies, 
Not 5157554851574950, but 51575556545656and regret 
For loss 5157554950575049overloved. 
Or if thou cove5157555450494948s utmost end 
Of misery, so thinking to evade 
The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God 
Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so 
To be forestalled; much more I fear lest 51575557575055
So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain 
We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts 
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest 
To make death in us live:  Then let us seek 
Some safer resolution, which methinks 
I have in view, call51575555495455mind with heed 
Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise 
The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless 
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe, 
Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived 
Against us this deceit:  To crush his head 
Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost 
By death brought on ourselves, or childless days 
Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe 
Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we 
Instead shall double ours upon our heads. 
No more be mentioned then of violence515756495350494851575648544857; and wilful barrenness, 
That cuts us off from hope; and savours only 
Rancour and pride, impatience and despite, 
Reluctance a51575652524855God and his just yoke 
Laid 51575650535655necks.  Remember with what mild 
And gracious temper he both hear51575652524955judged, 
Without wrath or reviling; we expected 
Immediate dis5157574853524954we thought 
Was meant by death that day; when lo!to thee 
Pains only in child-bearing were foretold, 
And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy, 
Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope 
Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn 
My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse; 
My 51575653525155will sustain me; and, lest cold 
Or heat should injure us, his timely care 
Hath, unbesought, provided; 51575749545756hands 
Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged; 
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear 
Be open, and his heart to pity incline, 
And teach us further by what means to shun 
The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow! 
Which now the sky, with various face, begins 
To show us in this mountain; while the winds 
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks 
Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek 
Some better shroud, so5157574854554948warmth to cherish 
Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star 
Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams 
Reflected may with matter sere foment; 
Or, by collision of two bodies, grind 
The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds 
Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock, 
Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down 
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine; 
And sends a comfortable heat from far, 52484849515455might supply the sun:  Such fire to us52484851505356what may else be remedy or cure 
To evils52484849525755our own misdeeds have wrought, 
He will instruct us praying, and of grace 
Beseeching him; so as we need not fear 
To pass commodiously this life, sustained 
By him52484851495356ny comforts, till we end 
In dust, our final re52484854555355native home. 
What 52484854505555can we do, than, to the place 
Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall 
Before him reverent; and there confess 
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears 
Wate5248494854504949ound, and with our sighs the air 
Frequenting, sen52484854535555hearts contrite, in sign 
Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek

Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn 
From his displeasure; in whose look serene, 
When angry most he seemed and most severe, 
What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone? 
So spake our father penitent; nor Eve 
Felt less remorse: they, forthwith t5248494949485157them5248494950574951ell 5248494953575054both 52484949554855ed

Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood 
Praying; for from the mercy-seat above 
Prevenient grace descending had removed 
The stony 52484857504856ir hearts52484952485655ade new flesh 
Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed 
Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer 
Inspir52484957485156winged for Heaven with speedier flight 
Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port 
Not of mean suitors; nor important less 
Seemed 52484949555055etition, than when the ancient pair 
In fables old, less 52484950494956yet than these, 
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore 
The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine 
Of Themis stood devout.  To 5248495452485552484953575655rayers 
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds 
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed 
Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad 
With incense, where the golden altar fumed, 
B52485053525256great intercessour, came52485052554855ht 
52485054555355the Father's throne: them the glad Son 
Presenting, thus to 52484955515155de began. 
See$52484955515655, what first-fruits on earth are sprung 
From thy implanted grace in Man; these52485053564955
And 52485049565155, which in this 52485048535355censer mixed 
5248504950564952I thy priest 5248505156564948e bring; 
Fruits of more pleasing savour, 52485057575555y seed 
Sown with contrition in his heart52485055514855those 
Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees 
Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen 
From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear 
To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute; 
Unskilful with what words to pray, let me 
Interpret for him; me, his advocate 
And propiti52485051525455all his works on me, 
Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit52485054515156Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay. 
Accept me; and, in me, 52485056525655ese receive 
The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live 
5248515057574948e reconciled, at least his days 
Numbered, 52485056535755sad; till death, his doom, (which I 
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,) 
To better life52485056525255yield him: where with me 
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss; 
Made one52485055515456, as I with thee am one. 
To whom the5248515555564948ithout cloud, serene. 
All thy request for Man, accepted Son, 
Obtain; all 5248505653534950was my decree: 
But, longer in that 52485155495057to dwell, 
The law I gave to Nature him forbids: 
Those pure immortal elements, that know, 
No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, 
Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off, 
As a distemper, 52485149534855to air as 52485149565255
And mortal food; as may dispose him best 
For dissolution wrought by sin, that first 
D52485150565556ed all things, and of incorrupt 
Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts 
Created him endowed; with happine5248515257565752485154545556ity: that fondly lost, 
This other served but to eternize woe; 
Till I provided death: so death becomes 
His final remedy52485252575255aft52485250565355, 
Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined 
By faith and faithful works, to second 52485154485755Waked in the renovation of the just, 
Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed. 
But let us call to syno52485249485056e Ble52485157564855rough52485155515655's wide bounds: from them I will not hide 
My judgements; how with mankind I proceed, 
As 52485155575157peccant Angels late they saw52485251485556n their state, though firm, stood more confirmed. 
He ended, and the Son gave signal high 
To the bright minister that watched; he blew 
His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps 
When God desce524852495156494852485248524956once more 
To sound at general doom.  The angelick blast 
Fill52485257565257e region5248525349484949ir blisful bowers 
Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring, 
By the waters of life, where'er they sat 
In fellowships of joy, the sons of light 
Hasted, resorting to the summons high; 
And took 52485255575055eats; till from his throne supreme 
The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will. 
O Sons, like one of us Man is become 
To know both good and evil, since his taste 
Of that defended fruit; but let him boast 
His knowledge of good lost, 52485254525056 got; 
Happier! had it sufficed him to have known 
Good by itself5248525457534949not at all. 
He sorrows now, repents52485351505355rays contrite, 
My motions in him; longer than they move, 
His heart I know, how variable and vain, 
Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand 
Reach also of the tree5248535348544948and eat52485357504855live for ever, dream at least to live 
F52485257524957to remove him I decree52485348495255send him 52485356485656 garden forth to till 
The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. 
Michael, this my behest have thou in charge; 
Take52485356574955e from among the Cherubim 
Thy choice of flaming warriours, l52485353494855 Fiend, 
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade 
Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:52485450515055 thee, and 52485353545457Paradise of God 
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair; 
From hallowed 52485354575555the unholy; and denounce 
To them, and to their progeny, f52485356544955nce 
Perpetual banishment.  Yet5248535552574948y faint 
A52485354505055ad sentence rigorously urged, 
(For I behold them softened, and with tears 
Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide. 
If patiently thy bidding they obey, 
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal 
To Adam what shall come in future days, 
As I shall thee enlighten; intermix 
My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed; 
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: 
And on the east side 5248545657525552485455555555place, 
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs, 
52485455535355ck watch; and of a sword the flame 
Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright52485548575255guard all passage52485457575755 tree of life: 
Lest 52485456545757a receptacle prove 
To Spirits foul, and all my trees t52485456554855ey; 
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude. 
He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared 
For swift descent; with him the cohort bright 
Of watchful 52485454555155m: four faces each 
Had, like a double Janus; all their shape 
Spangle52485550505055eyes more numerous than those 
Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse, 
Charme52485551575655Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed 
Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while, 
To re-salute the world with sacred light, 
Leucothea wake52485548495355with fresh dews imbalmed 
The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve 
Had ended now52485550545355orisons, and found 
Strength added from above; new hope to spring 
Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked; 
Which thus to Eve his welcome words 52485557515055. 
Eve, easily my faith admit, that all 
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends; 
But52485548495355from us aught should ascend to 52485548534855
So prevalent as to concern the mind 
Of God high-blest, or to inclin52485550575755ill, 
Hard to belief may seem; yet th52485549535055 prayer 
Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne 
Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought 
By 52485551504955the offended Deity to appease; 
Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart; 
Methought I saw him placable and mild, 
Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew 
That I was hear52485649574856avour; peace returned 
Home to my breast, and to my memory 
His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; 
Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now 
Assures me 52485554545255e bitterness of death 
Is p52485555554857we shall live.  Whence hail52485649494955e, 
Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind, 
M5248555550574951things living, since by thee 
Man is to live; and 5248555650514952e for Man. 
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. 
Ill-worthy I such title 52485655515455belong 
To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained 
A help, became thy snare; to me reproach 
Rather belongs, distrus52485653495055all dispraise: 
But infinite in pardon was my Judge, 52485654575355, who first brought death on all, am graced 
The source of life; next favourable thou, 
Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st, 
Far other name deserving.  But the field 
To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed, 
Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn, 
All unconcerned with our unrest, begins 
Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth; 
I never from thy side henceforth to stray, 
Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined 
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, 
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks? 
Here 52485656485355live52485655525057in fallen state, content. 
So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate 
Subscribed not:  Nature first gave signs, impressed 
On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed, 
After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight 
The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, 
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove; 
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods, 
First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace, 
Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind; 
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight. 
Adam observed, and with his eye the chase 
Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake. 
O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh, 
Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows 
Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn 
Us, haply too secure, of our discharge 
From penalty, because from death released 
Some days: how long, and what till then our life, 
Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust, 
And thither must return, and be no more? 
Why else this double object in our 52494851545655Of flight52494850515357in the air, and o'er the ground, 
One way the self-same hour? why 52485755535255east 
Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light 
More orient in yon western cloud, that draws 
O52485757535656blue firmament a radiant white, 
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught? 
He erred not; for by this the 52485757555057bands 
5249485753524950sky of jasper lighted now 
In Paradi52494850525156on 52494948535555made halt; 
A glorious apparition, had not doubt 
And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye. 
Not that more 52494850485656, when the Angels met 
Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw 
The field pavilioned 52494950545057guardians bright; 
Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared 
In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire, 
Against the Syrian king, who to surprise 
One man, assassin-like, had levied war, 
War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch 
In their52494854555555 stand there left his Powers, to seise 
Possession of the garden; he alone, 
To find where Adam sheltered, took his way, 
Not unperceived of Adam; 52494856545055Eve, 
While the great visitant approached, thus spake. 
Eve$ now expect great tidings, which perhaps 
Of us will soon determine, or impose 
New laws to be observed; for I descry, 
From yonder blazing cloud that veil52494955505755ill, 
One 5249494955525552494956505057host; and, by his gait, 
No5249485751494948meanest; some52494949565655Potentate 
Or 52494951525655Thrones above; such majesty 
Invests him coming! yet not terrible, 
That I should fear; nor sociably mild, 
As Raphael, th5249494949504950much confide; 
But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend, 
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. 
He ended:52494950494855e Arch-Angel52494954565155rew nigh52494956544855in his shape celestial, but as man 
Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms 
A military vest of purple flowed, 
Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain 
Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old 
In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof; 
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime 
In manhoo52495052564956youth ended; 52495049575055side, 
As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword, 
Satan's dire dread; and52495048484956hand the spear. 
Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state 
Inclined not, but his coming thus declared52494956494955, Heaven's high behest no preface needs: 
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death, 
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, 
Defeated of his seisure many days 
Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent, 
And one bad act with many deeds well done 
Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased, 
Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim52495149495155longer in this Paradise to dwell 
Permits not: to remove thee I am come, 
And send thee from the garden forth to till 
The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil. 
He added not; for Adam at the news 
Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, 
That all52495056525755nses bound; Eve, who unseen 
Ye52495052525555ad heard, with audible lament 
Discovered soon the place of her retire. 
O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death! 
Must I thus leave thee$52495057565357?5249505357504950
Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades, 
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, 
Quiet though sad, the respite of that day52495148545455must be mortal to us both.  O flowers52495149535456never will in other climate grow, 
My early visitation, and my last 
 ;t even, which I bred up with tender hand 
F52495153545156first opening bud, and gave ye names! 
Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank 
Your tribes, and water 52495155574957ambrosial fount? 
Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned 
With what to sight or smell was sweet! 52495248485656e 
H52495150575357I part52495150555255hither wander down 
Into a lower world; to this obscure 
And wild? ho52495152555356we breathe 52495154554857air 
Less pure, accustomed to im52495155575655fruits? 
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild. 
Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign 
What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart, 
Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine: 
Thy going 52495152565255lonely; with thee goes 
Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound; 
Where he abides, think there thy 5249525354494949. 
Adam, by this 52495250485257cold sudden damp 
Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned, 
To Michael thus his humble words addressed. 
Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named 
Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem 
Prince above princes! gently hast thou told 
Thy message52495257484956might else in telling wound, 
And in performing end us; what besides 
Of sorrow, and dejection52495157565656spair, 
Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring, 
Departure 52495348575455is happy place, our sweet 
Recess, and only consolation left 
Familiar to our eyes! all places else 
Inhospitable appear52495251554857olate; 
Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer 
Incessant I could hope to change the will 
Of Him who all things can, I would not cease 
To weary him with my assiduous cries: 
But prayer against his absolute decree 
No more avails than breath 52495252565456the wind, 
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth: 
Therefore to his great bidding I submit. 
This most afflicts me, that, departing hence, 
A52495353565455his face I shall be hid, deprived 
His blessed countenance:  Here 52495348565156frequent 
With worship place by place where he vouchsafed 
Presence Divine; and to my sons relate, 
'On this mount he appeared; under this tree 
'Stood visible; a52495357514856se pines his voice 
'I heard; here with him at this fountain talked: 
So many grateful altars52495353545557rear 
Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone 
Of lust5249535753554948e brook, in memory, 
Or monument to ages52495351525755heron 
Offe52495448545055-smelling gums, and fruit52495349494856lowers: 
In yonder nether world where shall I seek 
His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? 
For though I fled him angry, yet recalled 
To life prolonged and promised race, I now 
Gladly behold 52495352484855but his utmost skirts 
Of glory; and far off his steps adore. 
To whom thus Michael with regard benign. 
Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth; 
No52495448534855rock only; his Omnipr52495450544855fills 
Land, sea52495353575255ir, and every kind that lives, 
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed: 
A52495355535155earth he gave thee to possess and rule, 
No despicable gift; surmise not then 
His 52495356575057to these narrow bounds confined 
Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been 
Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread 
All generations; and had hither come 
From 52495450555756ends of5249544953554948, to celebrate 
And reverence thee, their great progenitor. 
But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down 
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons: 
Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain, 
God is, as here; and will be found alike 
Present; and of 52495451524955sence many a sign 
Still following thee, still compassi52495450515155 round 
With goodne52495456515455paternal love, his face 
Expres5249554948535552495452495555steps the track divine. 
Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed 
Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent 
To show thee what shall come in future days 
To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad 
Expect to hear; supernal grace contending 
With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn 
True patience5249545551554948emper joy with fear 
And pious sorrow; equally inured 
By mod52495553485655 either state to bear, 
Prosperous or adverse: so shal52495549515455lead 
Safest thy life52495549555056st prepared endure 
Thy mortal passage when it comes.--Ascend 
This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) 
Here sleep below; whil52495556515055to foresight wakest; 
As o52495557485057sleptst, while she to life was formed. 
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied. 
Ascend, I follow52495556565656afe Guide, the path 
Th52495552485355est me; and to the hand of Heaven submit, 
However chastening; to the evil turn 
My obvious breast; arming to overcome 
By suffering, and earn rest from labour won, 
If so I may attain. -- So both ascend 
In the visions of God.  It was a hill, 
Of Paradise the highest; from whose top 
The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken, 
Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. 
Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round, 
Whereon, for different caus52495648495055Tempter set 
Our second Adam, in the wilderness; 
To show him all Earth's kingdoms52495654525555heir glory. 
His eye might there command wherever stood 
City of old or modern fam52495651545655seat 
Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls 
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can, 
And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne, 
To Paquin of Sinaean kings52495654545055hence 
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul, 
Down to the golden Chersonese; or where 
The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since 
In Hispahan5249564855544949the Russian Ksar 
In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance, 
Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken 
The empire of Negus to his utmost port 
Ercoco52495655495257 less maritim kings 
Mombaza, and Quilo52495650505555Melind, 
And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm 
Of Congo, and Angola farthest south; 
Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount 
The 52495749484956 of Almansor, Fez and Sus, 
Morocco52495653504855lgiers, and Tremisen; 
On Europe thence, 52495750515057 Rome was to sway 
The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw 
Rich Mexico, 52495751534857of Montezume, 
And Cusco in Peru, the richer se52495752535255Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled 
Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons 
Call El Dorado.  But to nobler sights 
Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed, 
Which that false fruit that promised clear52495656565556 
Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and ru52495755505155visual nerve, for he had much to see; 
And from the well of life three drops instilled. 
So deep the power of these ingredients pierced, 
Eve52504848535457inmost 52495752555456mental sight, 
That Adam, now enforced to close 52504848495655s, 
Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced; 
But him the gentle Angel by the hand 
Soon raised, and his attention thus reca524957525548555249575156524948ope thine eyes; and first behold 
The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought 
In some to spring52495755535057e; who never touche52495752525756xcepted tree; nor with the snake conspired; 
Nor sinned thy sin; yet 52495757535755at sin derive 
Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds. 
H52495757514855 he opene52495756535255beheld a field, 
Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves 
New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds; 
I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood, 
Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon 
A sweaty reaper from his tillage br52504850494855First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf, 
Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next, 
More meek, came 52504851555257firstlings of his flock, 
Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid 
The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed, 
On the cleft wood, 52504857544856due rights performed: 
His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven 
Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam; 
The other's not, for his was not sincere; 
Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked, 
Smote him into 52504856545755riff with a stone 
That beat out life; he fell;and, deadly pale, 
Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused. 
Much at 52504951515455ght was Adam in his heart 
Dismaye52504951515455thus in haste 52504854524955Angel cried. 
O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen 
To that meek man, who well had 52504949535256ed; 
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid? 
To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied. 
These two are brethren, Adam52504953535155o come 
Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain, 
For envy that his bro5250495154485552504952555257found 
F5250495255574949acceptance; but the bloody fact 
Will be avenged; a5250495657545552504953525656faith, approved, 
Lose no reward; though here thou see him die, 
Rolling in du52504957535655gore.  To which our sire. 
Alas! both for the de5250495354485652504948495656cause! 
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way 
I must return to native dust?  O sight 
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, 
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! 
52504955545056thus 52504955555755.  Death thou hast seen 
In his first shape on Man; but many shapes 
Of Death, and many are 52504953505755s that lead 
To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense 
More terrible at the entrance, than within. 
Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die; 
By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more 
In meats and drinks, 52505048565155n the earth shall bring 
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew 
Before the52504955545656appear; that thou mayest know 
What misery the inabstinence of Eve 
S5250495650524949on Men.  Immediately a place 52504956525656his eyes52504956544955ed, sad, noisome, dark; 
A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid 
Numbers of 52505051495455eased; all maladies 
Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms 
Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds, 
Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, 
Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs, 
Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy, 
And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, 
Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, 
Dropsies, and asthma52505050495655joint-52505052565456rheums. 
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair 
Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; 
And over them triumphant Death his dart 
Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked 
With vows, as their chief good, and final hope. 
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long 
Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept, 
Though not of woman born; compassion quelled 
His best of man, and gave him up to tears 
A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess; 
And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed. 
O miserable mankind, to what fall 
Degraded, 52505055564956wretched state reserved! 
Better end here unborn.  Why is life given 
To be thus wrested from us? rather, why 
Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew 
What we receive, would either no accept 
Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down; 
Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus 
The image of God in Man, created once 
So goodly and erect, 52505156525255faulty since, 
To such unsightly sufferings be debased 
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man, 
Retaining still divine similitude 
In part, from such deformities be free, 
And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt? 
Their 5250515155514951, answered Michael, then 
Forsook them, when themselves they vilified 
To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took 
His image whom they served, a brutish vice, 
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. 
Therefore so abject is their punishment, 
Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own; 
Or if his 5250515455564949y t5250515749544948defaced; 
While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules 
To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they 
God's image did not reverence in 5250525049514948. 
I yield it just, said Adam, and submit. 
But is there yet no other way, besides 
These painful passages, how we may come 
To death, and mix with our connatural dust? 
There is5250524952565552505254515457if thou well observe 
The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught, 
In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence 
Due nouri52505255485656not gluttonous delight, 
Till many years over thy head return: 
So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop 
Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease 
Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature: 
This is Old Age; but then52505253485755must outlive 
Thy youth, thy streng52505252515656beauty; which will change 
To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then, 
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego, 
To w52505348505757hast; and, for the air of 52505255554855
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign 
A melancholy damp of cold and dry 
To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume 
The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor. 
Henceforth I fly not 52505354515255nor would prolong 
Life52505353565656ent rather, how I may be quit, 
Fair52505354514856easiest, of this cumbrous charge; 
Which I must keep till my appointed day 
Of rendering up, and patiently attend 
My dissolution.  52505448485355 replied. 
Nor love thy life52505355535556te; but 5250544850554948livest 
Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven: 
And now prepare thee for another sight. 
He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon 
Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds 
Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound 
Of instruments, that made melodious chime, 
Was heard, of harp and organ52505449555455who moved 
Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, 
Instinct through all proportions, low and high, 
Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. 
In other part stood one who, at the forge 
Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass 
Had melted, (whether found where casual fire 
Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, 
Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot 
To some cave's mouth; or w52505357515755washed by stream 
From underground;) the liquid ore he drained 
Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed 
First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought 
Fusil or graven in metal.  After these, 
But on the hi52505456574955de, a different sort52505450555655the high neigh52505453525755 hills, which was their seat, 5250545257564951plain descended; by their guise 
Just men they seemed, and all 52505450545655tudy bent 
To worship God aright, and know his works 
Not hid; nor those things last52505452545156might preserve 
Freedom and peace to Men; they 52505454525055plain 
Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! 
A bevy of fair women, richly gay 
In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung 
Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: 
The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes 
Rove without rein; till, in the 52505455515056net 
Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose; 
And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, 
Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat 
They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke 
Hy52505549495155en first to marriage rites invoked: 
With feast and musick52505553575056 tents resound. 
Such happy interview, and fair event 
O52505550495255and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, 
And charming symphonies, attached the heart 
Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight, 
The bent of nature; which he thus expressed. 
True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest; 
Much better seems this vision, and more hope 
Of peaceful days portends, than52505650545056wo past; 
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; 
Here Nature52505552565155fulfilled in all her ends. 
To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best 
By pleasure52505651515457to nature seeming meet; 
Created, as thou art, to nobler end 
Holy and pure, conformity divine. 
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were 5250565055494948
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race 
Who slew his brother; studious they appear 
Of arts that polish life, inventers rare; 
Unmindful of their Maker, 52505648545055his Spirit 
Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none. 
Yet52505557555655 beauteous offspring shall beget; 
For that fair female troop5250565051544950, that seemed 
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, 
Yet empty of all good 52505651545156consists 
Woman's domestick honour and chief praise; 
Bred on52505654484955completed to the taste 
Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, 
To dress, and troll the tongue, and 52505649565257eye: 
To these that sober race of men, whose lives 
Religious titled them the sons of God, 
Shall yield up all their virtue, a52505651495457fame 
Ignobly, 52505653555056rains and to the smiles 
Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy, 
Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which 
The world erelong a world of tears must weep5250575449525652505754505056Adam, of short joy bereft. 
O pity and shame52505750484955they, who to live well 
Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread 
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! 
But still I see52505755575056our of Man's woe 
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. 
From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, 
Said the Angel, who 52505748514955better hold his place 
By wisdom, and superiour gifts received. 
But now prepare thee for another scene. 
He looked52505748504855aw wide territory spread 
Before him, towns, and rural works between; 
Cities of men with lofty gate52505755535556wers, 
Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, 
Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise; 
Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, 
Single52505755555455array of battle ranged 
Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood; 
One way a band select from forage drives 
A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine, 
From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock, 
Ewe52514853494855heir bleating lambs over the plain, 
Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly, 
But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray; 
With cruel tournament the squadrons join; 
Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies 52505755524955arcasses and arms the ensanguined field, 
Deserted:  Others to a city strong 
Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine, 
Assaulting; others from the wall defend 
With dart and javelin, stones52514856535756lphurous fire; 
On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds. 
In other part the sceptered heralds call 
To council, in the city-gates; anon 
Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed, 
Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon, 
In factious opposition; till at last, 
Of middle age one rising, eminent 
In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong, 
Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace, 
And judgement from above: him old and young 
Exploded52514853555656d seized with violent hands, 
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence 
Unseen amid the throng: so52514853505155ce 
Proceed52514853565156oppression, and sword-law, 
Through all 5251495352554949and refuge none was found. 
Adam was 52514953555055tear52514950535755to his guide 
Lamenting turned full sad; O!what are these, 
Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death 
Inhumanly to men52514954485355ultiply 
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew 
His brother: for of whom such massacre 
Make they, but of their brethren; men of men 
But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven 
Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost? 
To whom thus Michael.  These52514951484856 product 
Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest; 
Where goo52514955495355bad were matched, who52514951485355mselves 
Abhor to join; and, by imprudence 52515049544856Produce prodigious births of body or mind. 
Such were these giants, 52514953515555high renown; 
For in those days might only shall be admired, 
And valour and heroick virtue called; 
To overcome in battle52515049525655ubdue 
Nation52515048575755bring home spoils with infinite 
Man-slaughter, 52514953515757he52515048545755highest pitch 
Of human glory; and for glory done 
Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours 
Patrons of mankind, God52515052564955sons of Gods; 
Destroyers rightlier52514956525355, and plagues of men. 
Thus fame5251495755544949chieved, renown on earth; 
And what most merits fame, in silence hid. 
But he, the seventh from thee52515053545255thou beheldst 
The only 52515053565357 in a world preverse, 
And therefore hated, the52514956495355so beset 
With foes, for daring single to be just52515052545155utter odious truth, that God would come 
To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High 
Rapt in a balmy clou52515057495755winged steeds 
Did, a5251514848544951, receive, to walk with God 
High in salvation and the climes of bliss, 
Exempt from death; to show thee what reward 
Awaits the good; the rest what punishment; 
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. 
He look52515056574956saw the face of things quite changed; 
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar; 
All now was turned to jollity and game, 
To luxury and riot, feast and dance; 
Marrying or prostituting, as befel, 
Rape or adultery, where passing fair 
Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils. 
At length a reverend sire among them came, 
And of their doings great dislike declared, 
And testified against their ways; he oft 
Frequented their assemblies, whereso met, 
Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached 
Convers52515152525356repentance, as to souls 
In prison, under judgements imminent: 
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased 
Contending, and removed his tents far off; 
Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall, 
Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; 
Measured by cubit, length, and bread52515148525556highth; 
Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door 
Contrived; and of provisions laid in large, 
For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange! 
Of every beast52515151574855ir52515250484955insect small, 
Came sevens, and pair52515155575655entered in as taught 
Their order: last the52515248555055nd his three sons, 
With their four wive52515157575055God made fa52515152525255door. 
Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings 
Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove 
From under Heaven; the hills to their supply 
Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, 
Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky 
Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain 
Impetuou52515254505655continued, ti52515157505655earth 
No more was seen: the floating 52515253484955swum 
Uplifted, and secure52515249495755eaked prow 
Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else 
Flood overwhelme52515252575355them with 52515250565555ir pomp 
Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea, 
Sea without shore5251525650554950ir palaces, 
Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped 
And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late, 
All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked. 
How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold 
The end of all thy offspring, end so sad, 
Depopulation!  Thee another flood, 
Of tears and sorrow a 52515250565655thee also drowned, 
And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared 
By the Angel, on thy fee52515253575255stoodest at last, 
Though comfortless; as when a father mourns 
His children, all in view destroyed at once; 
And scarce52515352535055 Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint. 
O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I 
Lived ignorant of future! so had borne 
My part of evil only, each day's lot 
Enough to bear; those now, that were dispense52515350505055burden of many ages, on me light 
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth 
Abortive, to torment me ere their being, 
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek 
Hencefort52515349484855 foretold, what shall befall 
Him or h5251535249514949; evil he may be sure, 
Which neither his 52515350484956ing can prevent52515353495755he the future evil shall no less 
In apprehension than in substance feel, 
Grievous 52515353505055: bu52515351545655care now is past, 
Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped 
Famine and anguish will 52515448485755 consume, 
Wandering that watery desart:  I had hope, 
When violence was ceased, and war on earth, 
All would have then gone well; peace w5251535155504948crowned52515356575155length of happy days the race of Man; 
But I was far deceived; for now I see 
Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste. 
How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide, 
And whether h525154505653555251535549554950 will end. 
To whom thus Michael.  Those, whom last thou sawest 
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they 
First seen in acts of prowess eminent 
And great exploits, but of true virtue void; 
Who, having spilt much bloo52515450565255done much wast 
Subduing nations, and achieved thereby 
Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey; 
Shall chang52515548485456course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, 
Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride 
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace. 
The conquered also, and enslaved by war, 
Shall, with their freedom lost, all 52515453485155lose 
And fear of God; from 52515455515555eir piety feigned 
In sharp contest of battle found no aid 
Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal, 
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, 
Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords 52515456505655leave them to enjoy; for the earth52515453504855bear 
More than enough, that temperance may be tried: 
So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved; 
Justice and 5251545448534948, truth and faith, forgot; 
One man except, the only son of light 
In a dark age, a52515548484855example good, 52515548525457allurement, custom52515553484955 world 
Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn, 
The grand-child, with twelve sons encreased, departs 
From Canaan, to a land hereafter called 
Egypt, divided by the river Nile; 
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths 
Into the sea:  To sojourn in that land 
He comes, invited by a younger son 
In time of dearth; a son, whose worthy deeds 52515648524955him to be the second in that realm 
Of Pharaoh:  There he dies, and leaves his race 
Growing into a nation, and now grown 
Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks 
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests 
Or violence, he of their wicked way52515649555557them admonish; and before them set 
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe 
And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come 
On52515652545455impenitence; and shall return 
Of them derided, but of God observed 
The one just man alive; by his command 
Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst, 
To save himself, and houshold, from amidst 
A52515653545155devote to universal wrack. 
No sooner he52515653575056hem of man and beast 
Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged, 
And sheltered round; but 52515650535355 cataracts 
Of Heaven set open on the Earth52515649575555pour 
Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep, 
Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp 
Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise 
Abo52515648505655highest hills:  Then s52515655494855is mount 
Of Paradise by might of waves be moved 
Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood, 
With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, 
Down the great river to the opening gulf, 
And there take root an island salt and bare, 
The haunt of seals, and orc52515650545755sea-mews' clang: 
To teach thee that God attributes to place 
No sanctity, if none be thither brought 
By men who52515653545755frequent, or therein dwell. 
And now, what further shall ensue, behold. 
He looke52515656495155saw52515750515757hull on the 52515657495057hich now abated; for the clouds were fled, 
Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry, 
Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed; 52515748575656 clear sun on his wide watery glass 
Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew, 
As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink 
From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole 
With soft foot towards t52515756525555; who now had stopt 
His sluces, as the 52524848504955his windows shut. 
The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground, 
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed525157545153494852515748555756s of hills, as rocks, appear; 
With clamour thence the rapid currents drive, 
T5251575157524949retreating sea, their furious tide. 
Forthwith from out t52515756575355a raven flies, 
And after him, the surer messenger, 
A dove sent forth once and again to spy 
Green tree or 52515754515356where52515757554855foot may light: 
The second time returning, in his bill 
An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign: 
Anon dry5251575656555552515756485755s, and from his ark 
The ancient sire descends, with all his train; 
Then with uplifted hand52515754505455eyes devout, 
Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds 
A dewy cloud, and in t52524855495056 a bow 
Conspicuous with three 52515755575355colours gay, 
Betokening peace from Go52515755575755covenant new. 
Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad, 
Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth. 
O thou, who future things canst represent 
As 52515756555255, heavenly Instructer!  I revive 
At this last sight; assured that Man shall live, 
With all the creature52524853485455their seed preserve. 
Far less I now lam52524855565555 one whole world 
Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice 
For one man found so perfect, and so just, 
That God vouchsafes to raise another 52524850575755From him, and a52524856565455anger to forget. 
But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven 
Distended, as the brow of God appeased? 
Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind 
The fluid skirts of that same watery 52524949555555
Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth? 
To whom the Arch-Angel.  Dextrously thou aimest; 
So willingly doth God remit his ire, 
Though late repenting him of Man depraved; 
Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw 
The whole earth filled with violence5252494952514948flesh 
Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed, 
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight52524952504856he relents, not to blot out mankind; 
And makes a 52524957535357never to 52524954515755 
The earth again by flood; nor let the sea 
Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown th5252495652555552524957525756man therein or beast; but52524951545455he brings 
Over t525249495353494852524954525156will52524948575657set 
His triple-52524956545557bow, whereon to look, 
And call to mind his 52524951564956: Day and n52524952564855Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost, 
Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new, 
Both 52525050504955and Earth52524952525755in the just shall dwell.

As one who52524957575056journey bates at noon5252505056504948bent on speed; so here5252505250574953 paused 
Betwixt525250484848494852525049485656ed and world restored, 
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; 
Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes. 
Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and en52525052554956Man, as from a second stock, proceed. 
Much 5252495556564948yet to see; but I perceive 
Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine 
Must needs impair and weary human sense: 
Henceforth what is to come I will relate; 
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. 
This 52525049535756ource of Men, while yet but few, 
And while the dread of judgement past remains 
Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity52525149515056some regard to 52525050575756just and right 52525057575355lead their lives, and multiply apace; 
Labour52525050534856soil, and reaping plenteous crop, 
Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock, 
Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid, 
With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast, 
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell 
Long time in peace, by families and tribes, 
Under paternal rule: till one shall rise 
Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content 
With fair equality, fr52525054514956state, 
Will arrogate dominion undeserved 
Over his brethre52525153535655quite dispossess 
Concord and law of nature5252514856574948earth; 
Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)52525151555755war, and hostile snare, such as refuse 
Subjection to his empire tyrannous: 
A mighty hunter thence he5252505753484948styled 
Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven, 
Or from 52525057485456claiming 52525157484857vranty; 
And from rebellion shall derive his name, 
Though of 5252514850514948others he accuse. 
He with a crew, whom like ambition joins 
With him or under him to tyrannize, 
Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find 
The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge 
Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell: 
Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build 
A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven52525155505455get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed 
In foreign lands, their memory be lost; 
Regardless whether good or evil fame. 
But God, who oft descends to visit men 
Unse52525252485056through their habitations walks 
To mark their doings, them beholding soon, 
Comes down to see52525156485755city, ere the tower 
Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets 
Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase 
Quite out their native language; and, instead, 
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: 
Forth52525254505255hideous gabble rises loud, 
Among the builders; 52525252515256other calls 
Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage, 
As mocked they storm: great laughter was in 52525348575557And looking down, to 52525252505755 hubbub strange, 
And hear the din:  Thus was 52525250555557ing left 
Ridiculou52525253515755the work Confusion named. 
Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased. 
O execrable son! so to aspire 
Above his brethren; to himself assuming 
Authority usurped, from God not given: 
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, 
Dominion absolute; that right we hold 
By his donation; but man over men 
He made not lord; such title 5252525451524949
Reserving, human left from human free52525352575555this usurper his encroachment proud 
Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends 
Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food 
Will he convey up thither, to sustain 
H52525348554956nd his rash army; where thin air 
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross52525352555755famish him of breath, if not of bread? 
To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest 
That son, who on the quiet state of men 
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue 
Rational liberty; yet know withal, 
Since thy original lapse, true 52525348515455 
Is lost, which always with52525354564955reason dwells 
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being: 
Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed, 
Immediately inordinate desires, 
And upstart passions, catch the government 
From reason; and to servitude reduce 
Man, till the52525448515156 Therefore, since he permits 
Within 52525451545656unworthy powers to reign 
Over free52525354535555, God, in judgement just, 
Subjects him from without to violent lords; 
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall 
His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be; 
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse. 
Yet sometimes nation52525452484855decline so low 
From virtue52525449555756is r52525356535455that no wrong, 
But justice, and some fatal curse annexed, 
Deprives them of their 5252535750505652525452555257
Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son 
Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame 
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse, 
Servant of servants, on his vicious race. 
Thus will this latter, as the former world, 
Still ten52525456515655bad to worse; till God at last, 
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw 
His presence from among them, and avert 
His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth 
To leave them to their own polluted ways; 
And one peculiar52525455565555 to select52525549545755all the rest, of whom to be invoked, 
A52525450575156from one faithful man to spring: 
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, 
Bred up in idol-worship:  O52525548555555men 
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, 
While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood, 
As to forsake the living God, and fall 
To 525254545549555252545657534949work in wood and stone 
For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes 
To call by vision, from 5252555250534948's house, 
His kindred, 52525456494955se Gods, into a land 
Which he will show him; and from him will raise 
A mighty52525551485255; and upon him shower 
His benediction so52525550505455in his seed 
All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys; 
Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes: 
I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith 
He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil, 
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now52525649515256d 
To Haran; after him a cumbrous train 
Of herds and flock52525550485456umerous servitude52525551565055wandering poor52525551545455rusting all his wealth 
With God, who called him, in 52525555505055unknown. 
Canaan he now attains; 52525553555456s tents 
Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring pla52525553514855Moreh; there by promise he receives 
Gift to his progeny of all that land, 
From Hameth northward to the Desart south; 
(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;) 52525553555355ermon east 52525553565655great western Sea; 
Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold 
In prospect, as I point them; on the shore 52525555484855Carmel; here, the double-founted stream, 
Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons 
Shall dwell to Senir52525654545155long ridge of hills. 
This ponder52525655525155all 52525655525056of the earth52525556565656525256564957495052525656485555sed:  By that seed 
Is meant thy great Deliverer, who 52525657515355ruise 
The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon 
Plainlier shall be revealed.  This patriarch blest, 
Whom faithful Abraham due time52525649535255call, 
A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves; 
Like him in faith, in wisdo52525657514855renown: 
The grand52525649575255with twelve sons increased, departs 
From 52525749515555to 52525749555255hereafter 52525750505155
Egypt, divided by the river Nile 
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths 
In52525749565255sea. To sojourn in 52525750555057 
He comes, invited by a younger son 
In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds 
Raise him to be the second 52525653545056realm 
Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race 
Growing into a nation, and now grown 
Suspected to a sequent king52525750545355eeks 
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests 
Too numerous; whence of 52525654564855he makes them slaves 
Inhospitably, and kills52525656495155infant males: 
Till by two brethren (these 5252565555544951call 
Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim 
His people from enthralment, they return, 
With glory and spoil, back52525756525055ir promised land. 
But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies 
To know their God, or message to regard, 
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire; 
To blood unshed t52525756565256s m52525749525155turned; 
Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill 
With loathed intrus52525755565457fill all the land; 
His cattle must of rot and murren die; 
Botch52525754564855blains 5252575155574951flesh emboss, 
And 52525752515257eople; thunder mixed with hail, 
Hail5252575152544950fire, must rend the Egyptians sky, 
And wheel on the 52534851565555devouring where it rolls; 
What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain, 
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down 
Must eat, and 52525754545655ground leave nothing green; 
Darkness must overshadow52534848535357bounds, 
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days; 
Last, with one midnight stroke, a52534849565755first-born 
Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds 
T52534852515356-dragon tamed at length submits 
To let his sojourners depart52534849495055ft 
Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice 
More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage 
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea 
Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass, 
As on dry land, between two crystal walls; 
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand 
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore: 
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend, 
Though present in his Angel; who shall go 
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire; 
By day5253485149564948by night a 5253485153514955To guide52534852495557their journey, and remove 
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues: 
All night he will pursue; but his approach 5253495152544948defends b52534857495256ill morning watch; 
Then through the fiery pillar, and the 52534856505655
God looking forth will trouble 52534953545656host, 
And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command 
Moses once more his potent rod extends 
Over52534952495656; t52534952515555his rod obeys; 
O52534951495656embattled ranks the waves return52534857505755overwhelm their war:  The race elect 
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance 
Th5253494957534948wild Desart, not the readiest way; 
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, 
War terrify them inexpert, and fear 
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather 
Inglorious life with servitude; for life 
To noble and ignoble is more sweet 
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on. 
This als52535048574856they gain by their delay 
In52534953505155de wilderness; there they shall found 
Their government52534957555457ir great senate choos5253495550534953twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained: 
God 52534956545057mount of Sinai, whose gray top 
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself 
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound, 
Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain 
To civil justice52534953555756religious rites 
Of sacrifice; informing them, by types 
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise 
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve 
Mankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God 
To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech 
That Moses might report to them his will52535056564855terrour cease; he grants what they besought, 
Instructed that to God is no access 
Without Mediator52535052565556high office now 
Moses in figure bears; to introduce 
One greater, of whose day 52535051535357foretel5253505051575552535057495455 Prophets in their age the tim52535053574855great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and 52535054574955Established, such delight hath God in Men 
Obedient to 5253505354484948that he vouchsafes 
Amo52535056535155 to set up his tabernacle; 
The Holy One with 52535056484855Men to dwell: 
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed 
Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein 
An ark, and in the ark his testimony, 
The records of his covenant; over these 
A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings 
Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn 
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing 
The heavenly fires5253505553504948 tent a cloud 
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night; 
Save when they journey, and at length they come, 
Conducted by his Angel, to the land 
Promised to Abraham and his seed:--The rest 
Were long to tell; how many battles fought 
Ho52535056545355kings destroyed; and kingdoms won; 
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still 
A day entire, and night's due course adjourn, 
Man's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand, 
'And thou moon 52535154575755vale of Aialon, 
'Till Israel overcome! so c52535249525756third 
From52535152545156, son of Isaac; and from him 
His whole descent, who thus52535250535755Canaan win. 
Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven, 
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things 
Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern 
Just 5253515751515049 now first I find 
Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased; 
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become 
Of me and all mankind:  But now I see 
His day, in whom all nation52535157505256be blest; 
Favour unmerited by me, who sought 
Forbidden knowledge by for52535154535155means. 
This yet I apprehend not, why to those 
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth 
So many and so various laws are given; 
S5253515649495552535156485155gue so many sins 
Among them; how can God with such reside? 
To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin 
Will reign am52535248485656, as of thee begot; 
And therefore was law given52535248495355to evince 
Their natural pravity, by stirring up 
Sin against law to fight: that when they see 
Law can discover sin, but not remove, 
Save by those shadowy expiations weak, 
The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude 
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man; 
Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness 
To them by faith imputed5253525253524949find 
Justification towards God, and peace 
Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies 
Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part 
Perform; and, not performing, cannot live. 
So law appears imperfect; and but given 
With purpose to resign them, in full time, 
Up to a better covenant; disciplined 
From 52535349505756types to truth; from flesh to spirit; 
From imposition of strict laws to free 
Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear 
To filial; works of 5253535350495552535256484957faith. 
5253535455504952shall not Moses, though of God 
Highly beloved, being but the minister 
Of law, his people into Canaan lead; 
But Joshua, 52535448505155e Gentiles Jesus call, 
His name and office bearing, who52535349565355quell 
The adversary-Serpent, and bring back 
Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man 
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. 
Mean while they, in their earthly 52535352515055placed, 
Long time52535353555755dwell and prosper, but when sins 
National interrupt52535351535255publick peace, 
Provoking God to raise them enemies52535357544856whom as oft he saves them penitent 
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom 
The second, both for piety renowned 
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive 
Irrevocable, that his regal throne 
For ever shall endure; the lik52535450565556sing 
All Prophecy, that of the royal stock 
Of David (so I name this king)52535355575656ise 
A Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold, 
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust 
All nations; and to kings f52535356525257of kings 
The last; for of his reign shall be no end. 
But 52535450565755a long succession must ensue; 
And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed, 
The clouded ark of God, till then in tents 
Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine. 
Such follow him, as 52535450534857registered 
Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll; 
Whose foul idolatries, and other faults 
Heape52535454495656 popular sum, will so incense 
God, as to leave them, and expose their land, 
Their city, his temple, and his holy ark, 
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey 
To that proud52535452505555whose high walls thou sawest 
Left in confusion; Babylon thence called. 
There in captivity he let52535553514855dwell 
The space of seventy years; then brings them back,

Returned from 52535456504956by525355485153555253555255554951ir lords, whom God disposed, the house of God 
They first re-edify; and for a while 
In mean estate live moderate; till, grown 
In 5253555452524949multitude, factious they grow; 
52535555575057 among the priests dissention springs, 
Men who attend the altar, and should most 
Endeavour peace:52535554495455strife pollution 52535551575455
Upon the52535557505156itself: at last they seise 
The scepter, and regard not David's sons; 
Then lose it to a stranger, that the true 
Anointed King Messiah might be born 
Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star, 
Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come; 
And guides the eastern sages, who inquire 
His place, to offer 52535651545655, myrrh, and gold: 5253555152544948 of 52535552555457olemn Angel tells 
To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; 
They gladly thither haste, and by a 52535553575555Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung. 
A virgin is his mother, but his sire 
The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend 
The throne hereditar52535654514955bound his reign 
With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens. 
He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy 
Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears, 
Without the vent of words; which these he breathed. 
O prophet of glad tidings, finisher 
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand 
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain; 
Why our great Expectation should be called 
The seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail, 
High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins 
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son 
Of God 5253565549554949so God with Man unites! 
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise 
Expect with mortal pain:  Say where and when 
Their fight, what stroke shall 52535651545255the victor's heel. 
To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of the5253565252504948
As of a duel, or52535655495755cal wounds 
Of head or heel:  Not therefore joins 52535655535557Manhood to Godhead, w52535655485655e strength to foil 
Thy enemy; nor so is overcome 
Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, 
Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound: 
Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, 
Not by destroying 52535656525355but his works 
In thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be, 
But by fulfilling that 52535755545756ou didst want, 
Obedience to the law of God, imposed 
On penalty of death, and suffering death; 
The 52535657505356to thy transgression due, 
And due52535748524855irs which ou52535753525355ine will grow: 
So only can high Justice rest appaid. 
T5253575048534951 exact he shall fulfil 
Both by o52535751485457and by love, though love 
Alone 5253574952575552535751565655; thy punishment 
H52535757555656endure, by coming in the flesh 
To a reproachful life, and cursed 52535753505756Proclaiming life to all who 52544849575355elieve 
In his redemption; and that his 52535753495357, 
Imputed, be52535757564856eirs by faith; his merits 
To save them52544849505455heir own, 52535754545356egal, works. 
For this 52535755555457live hated, be blasphemed, 
Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned 
A shameful and accursed, nailed52544850515356cross 
By his own nation; slain for bring52535757505156: 
But 5253575453504951he nails thy enemies, 
52544850515456that is against 5254485356514948the sins 
Of all mankind, with him there crucified, 
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust52544855575155is his satisfaction; so he dies, 
But soon revives; Death over him no power 
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light 
Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise 
Out of his grave, fresh as the 5254484853514951, 
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, 
His death for Man, as many as offered life 
Neglect not5254485348524948benefit embrace 
By faith not void of works:  This God-like act 
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died, 
In sin for ever lost from life; this act 
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength, 
Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms; 
And fix far deeper in his head their stings 
Than temporal death shall 5254485356494949victor's heel, 
Or theirs whom he 52544857485755; a death, like sleep, 
A gentle wafting to immortal life. 
Nor after resurrection52544949575155he stay 
Longer on earth, than certain times to appear 
To his disciples, men who 52544857495055life 
Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge 
To teach all nations what of him they learned 
And his salvation; them who 52544949525255elieve 
Baptizing in the profluent strea52544952565155sign 
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life 
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, 
For 5254495156554950that which the Redeemer died. 
A5254495051514949they shall teach; for, from that day, 
Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins 
Sa5254495154565552544951545557 preached, but 5254494954524950
Of 5254494955574948faith wherever through the world; 
S52544954555757seed 525449545153495052544950575357blest. 
Then 52544951555755Heaven of Heavens he52545048535355ascend 
With victory, triump525449545748555254495249504948air 
Over his foes and thine; there52545050505755surprise 
The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains 
Through all his realm, and there confounded leave; 
Then enter into glory, and resume 
His seat at God's right hand, exalted high 
Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come, 
When this world's dissolu5254504950494952ripe, 
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead; 
To judge the unfaithful dead52545050575457reward 
His 5254495552555652544957565356ceive them into bliss, 
Whether5254495757504948 or Earth; for then the Earth 
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place 
Than this of Eden, and 5254495749504950days. 
So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused, 
As at t52545055515156's great period; and our sire, 
Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied. 
O Goodness infinite, 5254504854534948mmense! 
That all this good of evil shall produce, 
And evil turn to good; more wonderful 52545052525456at which by creation first brought forth 
Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand, 52545055514957I should repent me now of sin 
By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice 
Much more, that m52545051535256 good thereof shall spring; 
To God52545052504855lory, 52545052525557-will to Men 
From God52545053535655ver wrath gra52545151524957abound. 
But say, if our Deliverer up to 52545150505355
Must re-ascend, what will betide the few5254515156554954left among5254515255524954herd, 
The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide 
His people, who defend?  Will they not deal 
Worse with his followers than 52545055515355m they dealt? 
Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from 52545148544956He to his own a Comforter will send, 
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell 
His Spirit within them; and the law of faith, 
Working through love, upon their hearts shall write, 
To guide them in all truth; and also arm 
With spiritual armour, able to resist 
Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts; 
What man can do against them, not afraid, 
Though to the death; a52545150485755such cruelties 
With inward consolations recompensed, 
And oft supported so a52545153515756amaze 
Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, 
Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends 
To evangelize the nations, then on all 
Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue 
To speak all tongue52545156535255do all miracles, 
As did their Lord before them.  Thus 52545251484955n 
Great numbers of each nation to receive52545249515055joy the tidings brough5254525251524951:  At length 52545157574955ministry performed, and race well run, 
Their doctrine 52545252565155ir story written left, 
They die; but in their room, a52545157555555forewarn, 
Wolve52545253574956succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, 
Who 52545250525155 sacred mysteries of 52545257505456To their own vile advantage52545256504956turn 
Of lucre and ambition5254525753544948truth52545256545356uperstitions and traditions taint, 
Left only in those w52545250575455records pure5254525748534948not but by the Spirit understood. 
Then 52545255515757y seek to avail themselves of names, 
Place52545349555655titles, and with these to join 
Secular power; though feigning still to act 
By spiritual, to the52545251535256appropriating 
The52545252544856of God, promised alike and gi52545255505156all believers; and, from that pretence, 
Spiritual laws by carnal power52545352565655force 
On every conscience; laws which none shall find 
Left them inrolled, or what 5254525656484949within 
Shall on the heart engrave.  What wi52545257535356then 
But force 5254534851564949of Grace itself, and bind 
His consort Liberty? what, but unbuil52545254535055living temples, built by faith to stand, 52545354575355own faith, not another's? for, on earth, 
Who against52545255575555and 5254534855534948 can be heard 
Infallible? yet many will presume: 
Whence heavy persecution52545356544855arise 
On all, who in the worship persevere 
Of spirit52545355575655uth; the rest, far greater part, 
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms 
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire 
Bestuck with slanderous dart52545357515256orks of faith 
Rarely be found:  So s52545448565556 world go on, 
To good malignant, to bad men benign; 
Under her own weight groaning; t52545356515055 day 
Appear of respiration to the just, 
And vengeance 52545350545155wicked, at return 
Of him so lately 52545450574957to thy ai52545357515355 Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold, 
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord; 
Last, 52545357525455clouds, from Heaven to be revealed 
In glory of the Father, to dissolve 
Satan with his perverted world; then raise 
From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined, 
New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, 
Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love; 
To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss. 
He ended; and thus Adam last replied. 
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, 
Measured this transient world, the race of time, 
Till time stand fixed!  Beyond is all abyss, 
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach. 
Greatly-instructed I52545457484855hence depart; 
52545448485755 in peace of thought; and have my fill 
Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain; 
52545450535255which was my folly to aspire. 
Henceforth I learn, that to obey is be52545548535457love with fear the only God; to walk 
As in his presence; ever to observe 
His providence; and on him sole depend, 
Merciful over all his works, with good 
Still overcoming evil, and by small 
Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak 
Subverting worldly strong, and 52545452524856wise 
By simply meek: that suffe52545550535256 truth's sake 
Is fortitude to highest victory, 
And, to the faithful, death the gate of life; 
Taught this by his example, whom I now 
Ac52545549575357 my Redeemer ever blest. 
To whom thus also the Angel 5254555449504953This having learned, thou hast attained the sum 
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars 
Thou knewest by name, and 52545456525756ethereal powers, 
All secrets of the deep, all Nature's 52545552544855
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea5254555549495552545548575556riches of this world enjoyed5254555648495752545548505157ule, one empire; only add 
Deeds to thy 5254555252564948answerable; add faith, 
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love, 
By name to come called charity, the soul 
Of 52545551545757est: then wilt thou not be loth 
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess 
A52545550545657 within thee, happier far.-- 
Let us descend now therefore from this top 
Of speculation; for the hour precise 
Exacts our parting hence; and see!the guards, 
By me encamped on yonder hill, expect 
Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword, 
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round: 
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; 
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed 
Portending good5254565254504948her spirits composed 
To meek submission: thou, at season fit, 
Let her with thee partake what 5254565554574948heard; 
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know, 
The great deliverance by her seed52545653535157
(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind: 
That ye may live, which will be many days, 
Both in one faith unanimous, though sad, 
With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered 
With meditation on the happy end. 
He ended, and they both 52545656564856the hill; 
Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve 
Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked; 
And thus with words not sad she him received. 
Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know; 
For God is also in sleep; and 52545748524955advise, 
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good 
Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress 
Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on; 
In me is no delay; 5254575055574948to go, 
Is to stay here; without thee here 5254565355575552545654484957go hence unwilling; thou to me 
Art all things under $Heaven, all places thou, 
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence. 
This further consolation yet secure 
I carry hence; though all by me is lost, 
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed, 
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore. 
So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard 
Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh 
The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill 
To their fixed station, all in bright array 
The Cherubim 52554848495655ed; on the ground 
Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist 
Risen from a river o'er the marish glides, 
And gathers 52545750545555fast at the labourer's heel 
Homeward returning.  High in front advanced, 
The brandished sword of God before them blazed, 
Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, 
And vapour as the Libyan air adust, 
Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat 
In either hand the hastening Angel caught 
Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate 
Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast 52554849514855 subjected plain; then disappeared. 
They, looking back, all 5254575554514950side beheld 
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat, 
Waved over by that flaming brand; the52545757534955With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms: 
Some natural tears they dropt, but wipe52554849505655soon; 
The world was all b5255485251554948, where to choose 
Their place of rest, and Providence52554856525555guide: 
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, 
Through Eden took52554948495355solitary way.
